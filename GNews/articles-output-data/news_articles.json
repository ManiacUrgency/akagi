We've been raising awareness about the need for rehab,\" Gladstone said. That work is showing signs of success. First responders in Manchester and Nashua have reported a dip in the number of deadly overdoses since January. Statewide, the Medical Examiner's Office has confirmed 170 deadly overdoses this year. The majority of those deadly overdoses involved fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. Advocates attribute the dip in deadly overdoses to years of work expanding access and education for opioid overdose reversal drugs like Narcan. While those drugs are powerful tools, they are not effective against a new threat now appearing in the state's illicit drug supply. Experts have been tracking a growing presence of xylazine, a strong tranquilizer, cut into other common street drugs like fentanyl. According to data from the medical examiner, xylazine was detected in 26 of the deadly overdoses this year. Overdose prevention and addiction treatment organizations have been working to get new tools to combat xylazine, including test strips that can detect the drug. \"They're just trying to get the xylazine test strips out there to hopefully prevent people from overdosing on xylazine,\" said Allison Pinski, an operations specialist for Riverbend, a behavioral services nonprofit that has recently started distributing xylazine test strips.\n\nOutside the New Hampshire statehouse Saturday evening, 430 candles were placed at the base of a granite statue.\n\nEach one represented a person who died from an overdose in the state last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe display was part of a demonstration organized by local advocates in honor of International Overdose Awareness Day.\n\nFor the last three years, it has been organized by Teresa Gladstone, who lost her grandson to fentanyl poisoning in 2020.\n\n\"We've been raising awareness about Narcan.

            "Maryland Matters"
        ],
        "text": "This article was republished with permission from WTOP\u2019s news partners at Maryland Matters. Sign up for Maryland Matters\u2019 free email subscription today.\n\nBaltimore officials this week laid out plans for how they intend to distribute the $252.5 million the city has received \u2013 so far \u2013 in settlements with pharmacies and drug companies over their role in the opioid crisis.\n\nMayor Brandon Scott signed an executive order Thursday creating an advisory board that will determine how to distribute the funds to help those city residents struggling with opioid addictions. The order also calls for the money to go toward programs for harm reduction, for treatment and recovery, education on opioid use and prevention of new opioid use.\n\nFunding will go to both government and community-based programs: Scott said that $20 million will go to the city\u2019s health department to continue work combating the opioid crisis, and $42 million had already been allocated to a dozen organizations in Baltimore fighting substance use disorders.\n\n\u201cWe cannot undue the harm that has been done, or bring back the lives that we lost,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe can, and we are, taking decisive actions to address this epidemic and prevent further loss of life, and repair the harm done to our community.\u201d\n\nHis announcement came just days before International Overdose Awareness Day, on Aug. 31, and he declared that the city would officially recognize the awareness day Thursday.\n\nScott noted that in the first seven months of 2024, Baltimore residents accounted for 44% of overdose deaths in Maryland, even though the city represents just 9% of the state\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cBaltimore has been disproportionately impacted by the scourge of addiction for longer than I\u2019ve been alive,\u201d said the 40-year-old Scott. \u201cThe dark, tangled relationship that our city, and far too many of our residents, have grappled with stems directly back to intentional disinvestment and systemic racism.\u201d\n\nBaltimore has passed on the opportunity to join other governments in lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, opting instead to take action on its own. The risks are higher by going it alone, but so are the potential rewards and so far that bet appears to be paying off.\n\nScott said that with the three settlements the city has agreed to so far, it has already recovered more it could have received under global settlements between drug makers and state and local governments. He said the city is still in litigation with five other drug makers for their alleged role in the crisis by flooding the market with prescription opioids. But he is confident in the city\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cWe still have fights to win against the largest companies of the batch. And as we continue negotiating and look towards our trial date of September 16th, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll win those cases too,\u201d Scott said.\n\nThe executive order signed Thursday sets up a framework for allocation of current and future settlement proceeds, establishing the Baltimore City Opioid Restitution Fund and creating a Restitution Advisory Board.\n\nThe advisory board will include at least four city residents with lived experience with substance use, social workers, public health advisers, a designee from a harm reduction center, two members of the Baltimore City Council, and the CEO of the local behavioral health authority. The board will also have three non-voting members: the executive director or a mayoral designee, the city health commissioner or a designee, and the fire chief or a designee.\n\nThe executive order creates the positions of executive director of overdose response and an opioid restitution program manager in the mayor\u2019s office. Finally, it requires the city to create a comprehensive overdose reduction strategy at least every two years. The plan is required to have community input, including from those who struggle with substance use disorders.\n\n\u201cThis executive order makes clear that we will do everything in our power to save lives and help our residents heal,\u201d Scott said. \u201cPart of what is outlined here includes direct community engagement from town halls, focus groups and online surveys so all residents, not just the few selected for the advisory board, will be able to have their voices heard in this process and be able to tell us and their neighbors where they\u2019d like to see this money going and what would make a difference in their lives and in the lives of their families.\u201d",

So, you have no idea what you're taking,\" said Gamez.\n\nThat's when Gamez and his wife decided to educate themselves, and now they work to spread awareness in Cleveland.\n\n\"Miles was a great kid, super smart, super energetic, taught himself how to play the guitar, he was in a band and just had a great personality,\" said Gamez.\n\nThe couple spends time with other families who have lost loved ones to overdose and people dealing with mental health issues, and they also hand out a few Narcan to people\u2014hoping to prevent families from experiencing their tragedy through outreach.\n\n\"We need to break the stigma and communicate with everybody. We know the dangers of this, recognize who needs help, talk to them, and if they're active user, help them to survive another day by showing them they have the chance for recovery. We don't need people dying senselessly,\" said Gamez.\n\nIn 2023, there were more than 3,500 deaths in Ohio due to fentanyl. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, 349 of those deaths were in Cleveland.\n\n\"The DEA has this great slogan called 'One Pill Can Kill.' Unfortunately, there's not one pill to fix it,\" said Gamez.\n\nThe One Pill Can Kill campaign aims to bring awareness to the significant nationwide surge in counterfeit pills that are marketed as legitimate but killing Americans.\n\n\"A lot of efforts have been made to try to mitigate that and prevent it. So, theoretically, the numbers should be higher, but the good work that people are doing in community organizations and across the DEA working to get the word out is making a difference,\" said DEA Group Supervisor Quinn Auten.\n\nLike the DEA's family summit happening Saturday, where they will put names and faces to a drug crisis. People will hear from families who lost loved ones to drug overdoses or drug poisoning.\n\n\"The information being presented there is going to be specific to families, things to look for, what the threat is in the community. There's no better place to start than the home for parents to understand what the threat is, know what their children are facing, and then spread that knowledge,\" said Auten.\n\nThey are showing people that fentanyl deaths are not limited by age, race or economic background.\n\n\"It's all kind of people that are dying; It's moms, dads, grandmas, sons, daughters and even friends. We're losing everybody that comes across fentanyl,\" said Gamez.\n\nAnyone can attend the family summit in Cleveland Public Square at 7 p.m. on Saturday.",

        "text": "BURLINGTON \u2013 Kimberly Blake. Amy Riley. Dawn Tatro. They are all parents who have lost a child to substance use disorder in Vermont.\n\nOn Thursday evening, they shared their stories of loss and hope at City Hall Park, where members of the community gathered to remember lives lost and advocated for overdose prevention and support.\n\nWith 65 deaths recorded through May of this year, opioid-related deaths were on the decline in Vermont for the first time since 2019. But advocates warned of new challenges such as Xylazine-laced opioids.\n\nXylazine, a horse tranquilizer and a popular adulterant for fentanyl, was involved in a third of the 95 accidental opioid overdose deaths that occurred in the state during a similar time frame in 2023.\n\nMany whose lives have been touched by the continuing opioid crisis highlighted the importance of breaking the silence and the stigma that still surrounds substance use disorder.\n\n\u201cWe are all people and we all deserve love and respect and compassion,\u201d said Martina Anderson, a social justice advocate and harm reductionist, who wants to see attitudes change \u201cbecause stigma still kills people.\u201d\n\nAbout 50 faces of people lost to overdoses were posted around the park as part of the third annual International Overdose Awareness Day event organized by Team Sharing Vermont to remember those lost to substance use disorder. It also coincided with Overdose Prevention Center National Solidarity Week.\n\nAmong them was Grace Riley\u2019s photo.\n\nGrace was 21 and wanted to be an addiction counselor. She had become addicted to Percocet after an accident, had undergone treatment and was doing well, said her mother Amy Riley. But then she died alone in her car in Maine in June 2022 after buying what she thought were Percocet pills in downtown Burlington.\n\n\u201cShe came home, she had dinner with us and she drove back to her apartment in Maine. Even before getting out of her car, she took one of the pills that she bought on Church Street, and she died instantly. It was 100% fentanyl,\u201d Amy Riley said in an interview Friday.\n\n\u201cAll it takes is one pill,\u201d she said.\n\nRiley was among families and advocates who applauded \u200b\u200bthe state Department of Health\u2019s guidelines on safer injection sites expected to be published next month, and the potential opening of an overdose prevention site in the city next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m completely in favor of it. I\u2019m really in favor of anything that involves preventing other people from dying,\u201d Riley said.\n\nMayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, a longtime proponent of an overdose prevention site in the city, joined other elected officials to commend the efforts that led to legislation this year to make way for one that she expects will open next year.\n\n\u201cLives will be saved,\u201d she said.\n\nLawmakers in June overrode a veto by Gov. Phil Scott of H.72, which paves the path for the creation of Vermont\u2019s first overdose prevention site in downtown Burlington, funded by $1.1 million in settlements with pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\u201cThis legislation would not have come to fruition today if it was not for the strong advocacy of the people here in Burlington, the vulnerability and sharing what it meant to lose your loved ones, and sharing what it would mean to have an overdose prevention center and to save lives moving forward,\u201d said Rep. Taylor Small, P/D-Winooski.\n\nThe annual event, said Mulvaney-Stanak, is an opportunity to remember and honor those who have been lost \u201cby committing ourselves to movements for change to end overdose, to challenge antiquated and harmful drug laws, and to foster understanding working towards a future where stigma is no longer a barrier to support care and recovery.\u201d\n\nSupport groups participated in the event by setting up information booths, advocating for ending stigma, promoting harm reduction and distributing free drug tests and Narcan kits.\n\nDakota Roberts, a harm reduction specialist from the AIDS Project of Southern Vermont, spoke about the importance of drug testing programs and said it is heartening to see the support there.\n\n\u201cRather than really thinking about the grief and the loss, I\u2019m more focused on how great it is to see so many people all together for one thing: trying to make a difference in other people\u2019s lives,\u201d Roberts said of Thursday\u2019s event.\n\nAs attendees wove around the posters of faces lost to addiction, a woman knelt and quietly placed a small framed photo of a young woman on the grass. She stepped back, wiped her eyes and walked back into the crowd.",

        "text": "Attorney General Lynn Fitch filed a lawsuit Thursday against pharmacy benefit managers that alleges the companies fueled the opioid epidemic by working with manufacturers to increase sales of the addictive drugs and magnify their profits.\n\n\u201cThey colluded with the opioid manufacturers, placed profits over safety, and engaged in a clandestine scheme to increase the sale of prescription opioids, despite the known dangers of these drugs,\u201d the filing states.\n\nThe suit names Optum, Evernorth Health, Express Scripts and several of the companies\u2019 subsidiaries as defendants. Optum is owned by UnitedHealth Group, and Evernorth Health and Express Scripts are owned by The Cigna Group.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers are the middlemen between pharmacies, drug manufacturers and insurers that negotiate drug prices, process claims for prescriptions and manage retail pharmacy networks.\n\nThe filing alleges that the companies conspired with Purdue Pharma and other opioid manufacturers to deceptively market and oversupply opioids to Mississippians. It also claims the defendants knew they were dispensing more prescription opioids than could be legitimate, contributing to an illegal secondary market.\n\nMississippi has the fourth-highest rate of opioid prescription rates in the nation. Sixty-four opioid prescriptions were dispensed per 100 people in the state in 2022, according to the CDC.\n\nMississippi is not the first state to file a lawsuit against pharmacy benefit managers for their alleged role in the opioid crisis. In June, Arkansas sued Express Scripts, Optum and their subsidiaries, citing similar claims.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers have faced increased scrutiny following a recent Federal Trade Commission report that suggested the companies \u201cmay be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies.\u201d\n\nConsolidation within the industry has led to the three largest pharmacy benefit managers \u2013 UnitedHealth Group\u2019s OptumRX, Cigna\u2019s Express Scripts and CVS Health\u2019s CVS Caremark \u2013 to manage nearly 80% of prescriptions filled in the U.S. in 2023, according to the report.\n\nIn June, Fitch joined an amicus brief in support of an Oklahoma law to strengthen regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, along with 31 other states.\n\nLawsuits filed by Fitch against companies that played a role in amplifying the opioid epidemic will yield $367 million in settlements over the next 18 years, according to the Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cI will continue to hold these companies accountable for the role that they have played in destroying so many lives through their unfair, deceptive practices so that our state can heal from this crisis and guard against it ever happening again,\u201d Fitch said.\n\nA bill aimed at regulating pharmacy benefit managers in Mississippi failed during this year\u2019s legislative session.\n\nThe Mississippi House of Representatives convened a committee aimed at studying possible changes to laws regulating pharmacy benefit managers. It will make recommendations to the Legislature for next year\u2019s session. The committee is chaired by Rep. Jerry Turner (R-Lee) and Rep. Beth Waldo (R-Ponotoc) and began meeting this summer.",

        "authors": [
            "Stephen Starr"
        ],
        "text": "Middletown, Ohio \u2013 The speech was JD Vance\u2019s chance to introduce himself to a national audience.\n\nA freshman senator from Ohio, Vance had only 18 months of experience in Congress when Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump picked him to be his 2024 running mate.\n\nIt was a Monday in July when the announcement about Vance\u2019s selection was made. By that Wednesday, Vance was on stage at the Republican National Convention, preparing to address voters across the United States.\n\nWhat he decided to share was a glimpse at his family\u2019s history with opioid addiction.\n\n\u201cOur movement is about single moms like mine who struggled with money and addiction but never gave up. I\u2019m proud to say that tonight my mom is here, 10 years clean and sober. I love you, mom,\u201d he said, as his mother, Bev Vance, blew him a kiss from the crowd.\n\nThe audience erupted in chants of \u201cJD\u2019s mom! JD\u2019s mom!\u201d Vance has made tackling the opioid crisis a mainstay of his campaign appearances ever since.\n\nThis month, when he rallied in Byron Center, Michigan, he outlined a vision in which he and Trump would close US borders to \u201cstop the drugs\u201d. Then, a few days later in Kenosha, Wisconsin, he called for drug dealers to receive the death penalty.\n\nBut in Vance\u2019s home state of Ohio, addiction experts and advocates say they have yet to hear policy proposals in this year\u2019s presidential race that would adequately address the complex nature of the opioid crisis.\n\nJackie Phillips Carter, the health commissioner for the city of Middletown, Vance\u2019s hometown, said neither Democrats nor Republicans have put forward viable solutions.\n\n\u201cThere are so many obstacles and roadblocks,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I don\u2019t think anybody is serious about addressing the issue.\u201d\n\nBarriers to access\n\nWhen advocate Dennis Cauchon reflects on the hurdles to confronting the opioid crisis, he thinks of his colleague Dylan Stanley.\n\nCauchon serves as president of Harm Reduction Ohio, a drug policy nonprofit based east of the state capital, Columbus. In 2018, he hired Stanley to lead community outreach.\n\nShe excelled at the role. Cauchon credits her with saving countless lives.\n\n\u201cDylan was one of our earliest and best distributors of naloxone,\u201d Cauchon said, referring to the nasal spray used to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.\n\nBut Stanley herself struggled with addiction, and she relied on methadone to treat her opioid use disorder.\n\nGetting the medication, though, required her to criss-cross Columbus by bus: Only certified treatment programmes can dispense the tightly regulated drug. And there was regularly a line at the door by the time she arrived.\n\nFour years ago this month, Stanley died of a probable overdose at age 30, Cauchon said. She left behind a two-year-old daughter, Ruby.\n\nWhile Cauchon said he respects Vance\u2019s personal story, he feels it is unlikely the Republican\u2019s hard-knuckle proposals will move the needle when it comes to helping those struggling with addiction, like Stanley.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he has a good understanding of what needs to be done. A lot of people are well-meaning but do the opposite of what\u2019s needed because it\u2019s a complex issue,\u201d said Cauchon.\n\n\u201cHis policies \u2014 increasing the drug war and prison sentences and arrests \u2014 do the opposite. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s his intent, but I do think that\u2019s the result.\u201d\n\nA chronicle of decline\n\nSince the mid-2010s, Ohio has consistently had one of the steepest proportions of overdose deaths in the country.\n\nWhile the number of deaths has fallen significantly in recent years, the state still averages 45.6 deaths for every 100,000 people \u2014 the 10th highest rate in the country.\n\nThe crisis hit Vance\u2019s hometown of Middletown particularly hard. In the five years from 2017 to 2022, Middletown\u2019s Butler County saw one of the most elevated rates of overdose-related deaths in the state.\n\nVance captured the crisis in his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. It painted a portrait of Middletown as a Rust Belt city in decline, full of shuttered shops and fading parks.\n\nIt also relayed the story of his mother\u2019s struggles with heroin and OxyContin, a prescription opioid.\n\nThe book\u2019s publication in 2016 propelled Vance to national stardom, and that same year, he established Our Ohio Renewal, a nonprofit formed to \u201ccombat Ohio\u2019s opioid epidemic\u201d.\n\nVance explained that the organisation\u2019s focus was to assist \u201cthe grandparents and aunts and uncles taking care of a lot of the kids who had been orphaned by the epidemic\u201d.\n\nIt even pushed the state legislature to support the \u201ccaregivers\u201d who help family members affected by opioid addiction.\n\nBut in 2021, Our Ohio Renewal closed down. It had faced criticism for employing an addiction specialist with ties to Purdue Pharma, a now-bankrupt pharmaceutical company accused of aggressively pushing highly addictive opioids like OxyContin to consumers.\n\nAnd the experts who spoke to Al Jazeera questioned whether the nonprofit amounted to much.\n\n\u201cIt really didn\u2019t do anything. I deal with this issue every day across the whole state, and we had no contact with it,\u201d said Cauchon. \u201cIt didn\u2019t do any good, but it didn\u2019t do any harm.\u201d\n\nFeeding stereotypes?\n\nSome critics, however, argue that Vance\u2019s depiction of the region did indeed cause harm, by feeding into stereotypes about the root causes of addiction.\n\nIn Hillbilly Elegy, for instance, Vance credits a \u201cculture in crisis\u201d with creating the situation in Middletown.\n\n\u201cYou can walk through a town where 30 percent of the young men work fewer than twenty hours a week and find not a single person aware of his own laziness,\u201d Vance writes.\n\nScotty Robertson, a pastor in Middletown who grew up in West Virginia\u2019s Appalachian coalfields, found Vance\u2019s airing of his family\u2019s addiction struggles problematic for several reasons.\n\nThe book, Robertson explained, allowed Vance to present himself as a paragon of success, while those around him are often depicted as uneducated and drug-addicted.\n\n\u201cI think the context in which the story is told actually reinforces the stereotype, in light of how he uses the story to elevate himself,\u201d he said.\n\nRobertson believes Vance\u2019s current political stance is another reflection of those stereotypes.\n\nVance, for example, has opposed \u201chousing-first\u201d policies that would offer lodging to those facing homelessness, for fear they would introduce \u201cpeople with serious drug problems\u201d into communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political agenda that dehumanises,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIf [his] story was told for Vance to achieve the right kinds of outcomes, then I think the story very much could have been used for the purpose of humanising.\u201d\n\nPhillips Carter, the Middletown health commissioner, also believes part of the difficulty in addressing addiction lies in breaking down stereotypes about who is vulnerable. She wants the public to understand that those struggling with addiction are simply everyday people.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge now is always bringing the human component,\u201d she said. \u201cSo often the biggest challenge is trying to bring the humanity and education that addiction is a disease.\u201d\n\nTurning the tide\n\nThere are also significant hurdles to getting treatment for addiction and related conditions, Phillips Carter added.\n\n\u201cMental health treatment is very difficult to get,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere is insurance. There is red tape. People can\u2019t go into multiple programming. Sometimes women can\u2019t get treatment where men go. Sometimes a family will lose its kids if [a parent] goes into treatment.\u201d\n\nBut she and other experts believe there is reason to be hopeful. Overdose deaths in Ohio are down 34 percent so far in 2024, compared to the same period last year.\n\nNationally, deaths fell in 2023 for the first time in five years. New federal regulations easing restrictions on methadone were also announced in April.\n\nOhio itself invests nearly $100m a year in prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery responses.\n\nCauchon, the president of Harm Reduction Ohio, credits local and state leaders like Governor Mike DeWine with working across party lines to lower the number of deaths.\n\n\u201cIs the response everything it could be?\u201d Cauchon asked. \u201cNo, but it\u2019s much better than five or 10 years ago.\u201d",

        "text": "In Pawtucket, R.I., near a storefront advertising \u201cfree\u201d cell phones, J.R. sat in an empty back stairwell and showed a reporter how he tries to avoid overdosing when he smokes crack cocaine.\n\n(NPR is identifying him by his initials because he fears being arrested for using illegal drugs.)\n\nIt had been several hours since his last hit, and the chatty, middle-aged man\u2019s hands moved quickly. In one hand, he held a glass pipe. In the other, a lentil-sized crumb of cocaine.\n\nOr at least J.R. hoped it was cocaine, pure cocaine \u2014 uncontaminated by any fentanyl, a potent opioid that was linked to nearly 80% of all overdose deaths in Rhode Island in 2022.\n\nHe flicked his lighter to \u201ctest\u201d his supply. If it has a \u201ccigar like sweet smell,\u2019\u2019 he said, it means that his cocaine is laced with \u201cfetty\u201d or fentanyl. He put the pipe to his lips and took a tentative puff. \u201cNo sweet,\u201d he said, reassured.\n\nBut this \u201cmethod\u201d he devises offers only false \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 reassurance. It\u2019s actually impossible to tell for sure if a drug contains fentanyl by the taste or smell. And a mistake can be fatal.\n\n\u201cSomebody can believe that they can smell it [fentanyl] or taste it, or see it\u2026but that's not a scientific test,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Josiah \u201cJody\u201d Rich, an addiction specialist and researcher who teaches at Brown University. \u201cPeople are gonna die today because they buy some cocaine that they don't know has fentanyl in it.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe mix of stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamines with fentanyl \u2013 a synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin \u2013 is driving what experts call the opioid epidemic\u2019s \u201cfourth wave.\u201d The mixture presents powerful challenges to efforts to reduce overdoses, because many users of stimulants don\u2019t know they are at risk of ingesting opioids and so don\u2019t take overdose precautions.\n\nThe only way to know if cocaine or other stimulants contain fentanyl is to use drug-checking tools such as fentanyl test strips \u2013 a best practice for harm reduction now embraced by federal health officials for combating drug overdose deaths. Fentanyl test strips cost as little as $2 for a two-pack online, but many front-line organizations also give them out for free.\n\nIn the U.S., the first wave of the long-running and devastating opioid epidemic began with the abuse of prescription painkillers (early 2000s); the second wave involved an increase in heroin use, starting around 2010.\n\nThe third wave began when powerful synthetic opioids like fentanyl started appearing in the supply around 2015.\n\nNow experts are observing a fourth phase of the deadly epidemic. Nationwide, illicit stimulants mixed with fentanyl were the most common drugs found in fentanyl-related overdoses, according to a study published in 2023 in the scientific journal Addiction.\n\nThe stimulant in the fatal mixture tends to be cocaine in the Northeast, and methamphetamine in the West and much of the Midwest and South.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing that people in the U.S. are dying from in terms of drug overdoses is the combination of fentanyl and a stimulant,\u2019\u2019 said Joseph Friedman, a researcher at UCLA and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\n\u201cBlack and African Americans are disproportionately affected by this crisis to a large magnitude, especially in the Northeast.\u2019\u2019\n\nFactors driving polydrug overdoses\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how much of the latest trend in polydrug use is accidental or intentional. A recent study from Millennium Health found that most people who use fentanyl do so at times intentionally and other times unintentionally.\n\nPeople often use stimulants to power through the rapid withdrawal from fentanyl, Friedman said. And the high-risk practice of using cocaine or meth with heroin, known as speedballing, has been around for decades.\n\nOther factors include manufacturers adding the cheap synthetic opioid to a stimulant to stretch out their supply, or dealers mixing up bags.\n\nBut in Rhode Island, researchers said, many people still think they are using unadulterated cocaine or crack \u2014 a misconception that can be deadly.\n\nStimulant users unprepared for fentanyl's ubiquity\n\n\u201cFolks who are using stimulants, and not intentionally using opioids, are unprepared to respond to an opioid overdose\u2026because they don't perceive themselves to be at risk,\u2019\u2019 said Jaclyn White Hughto, a Brown University epidemiologist and a principal investigator in a new, unpublished study called Preventing Overdoses Involving Stimulants.\n\nThe researchers surveyed more than 260 people in Rhode Island and Massachusetts who use drugs, including some who manufacture and distribute stimulants like cocaine.\n\nMore than 60% of the people they interviewed in Rhode Island had bought or used stimulants that they later found out had fentanyl in them.\n\nIn 2022, Rhode Island had the fourth highest rate of overdose deaths involving cocaine in 2022, after D.C., Delaware and Vermont. according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nPeople who don't regularly use opioids have lower tolerance, which puts them at higher risk of an overdose.\n\nAnd many of the people interviewed in the study also use drugs alone, so if they do overdose they may not be found until it\u2019s too late.\n\nDubois was a single mother raising two Black sons. The older son, Clifton, had been struggling with addiction since he was 14, she said. Clifton also had been diagnosed with ADHD and a mood disorder.\n\nBack in March 2020, Clifton had just checked into a rehab program as the pandemic ramped up, Dubois said.\n\nBecause of the lockdown at rehab, Clifton was upset about not being able to visit with his mother. \u201cHe said, \u2018if I can\u2019t see my mom, I can\u2019t do treatment,\u2019\u201d Dubois recalled. \u201cAnd I begged him\u201d to stay in treatment.\"\n\nBut soon after, Clifton left the rehab program. He showed up at her door. \u201cAnd I just cried,\u201d she said.\n\nDubois\u2019s younger son was living at home. Dubois didn\u2019t want Clifton doing drugs around his younger brother. So she gave Clifton an ultimatum: \u201cIf you want to stay home, you have to stay drug free.\u201d\n\nClifton went to stay with family friends, first in Atlanta, and later in Woonsocket, an old mill city that has Rhode Island's highest rate of drug overdose deaths.\n\nIn August of 2020, Clifton overdosed but was revived. Clifton later confided that he\u2019d been snorting cocaine in a car with a friend, Dubois said.\n\nHospital records show he tested positive for fentanyl.\n\n\u201cHe was really scared,\u201d Dubois said. After the overdose, he tried to \u201cleave the cocaine and the hard drugs alone,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cBut he was taking pills.\u201d\n\nEight months later, on April 17, 2021, Clifton was found unresponsive in the bedroom of a family member\u2019s home.\n\nThe night before, Clifton had bought counterfeit Adderall, according to the police report. What he didn\u2019t know was that the Adderall pill was laced with fentanyl.\n\n\u201cHe thought by staying away from the street drugs\u2026and just taking pills, like, he was doing better,\u2019\u2019 Dubois said. \u201cI do truly believe Cliff thought he was taking something safe.\u201d\n\nThe opioid epidemic is driving up the mortality rate among older Black Americans (ages 55-64) and, more recently, Latinx people, according to a study recently published in The American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nBut it\u2019s too simplistic to merely focus on whether fentanyl is present, or not, said Joseph Friedman, the researcher at UC San Diego and the study\u2019s author.\n\nFor years, hospitals have safely used medical grade fentanyl for surgical pain because the potency is strictly regulated.\n\n\u201cIt's not the strength of fentanyl, that's risky,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt's the fact that the potency fluctuates wildly in the illicit market.\u201d\n\nStudies of street drugs, he said, show that in illicit drugs the potency can vary from 1% to 70% fentanyl.\n\n\u201cImagine ordering a mixed drink in a bar and it contains one to 70 shots,\u2019\u2019 Friedman said, \u201cand the only way you know is to start drinking it\u2026There would be a huge number of alcohol overdose deaths.\u2019\u2019\n\nDrug checking technology can provide a rough estimate of fentanyl concentration, he said, but to get a precise measure requires sending drugs out to a laboratory.\n\nFentanyl test strips offer a low-cost way to prevent overdoses by detecting the presence of fentanyl, regardless of potency, in cocaine and other illicit drugs.\n\nIn Rhode Island, the test kits are available for free from harm reduction groups such as Project Weber/Renew.\n\nBut the test strips only work if people use them \u2013 and then don\u2019t consume the drugs if they test positive for fentanyl. And not enough people who use stimulants do.",

I will continue to hold these companies accountable for the role that they have played in destroying so many lives through their unfair, deceptive practices so that our state can heal from this crisis and guard against it ever happening again.\u201d\n\nThe release also mentions a Federal Trade Commission report released earlier this year that calls out PBMs for their enormous size, scope and business practices.\n\n\"The report notes that, 'The top three PBMs processed nearly 80% of the approximately 6.6 billion prescriptions dispensed by U.S. pharmacies in 2023,...' This includes defendants in the AGO lawsuit.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1999 through 2021, opioid overdoses killed nearly 645,000 people. In 2022, Mississippi had 64 opioids being given to patients for every 100 people, making the state fourth in the nation in opioid prescription rates. That number is nearly two times higher than the national average.\n\nSince she took office, Fitch has attached the state onto several national lawsuits with pharmaceutical companies who were found responsible for amplifying the opioid epidemic. The AG's office has entered into settlements with several of those companies, including manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and others. Those suits will bring $367 million to the state in settlements over the next 18 years.\n\nMore on PBMsPharmacists, Pharmacy Benefit Managers, argue over high drug, business costs at hearing\n\nWhat Are Opioids?What you need to know\n\nThose companies mentioned in the lawsuit are Optum, Inc., OptumRx, Inc., OptumInsight Life Sciences, Inc, OptumInsight, Inc., UnitedHealth Group, Inc., The Lewin Group, Inc., Evernorth Health, Inc., Express Scripts, Inc., Express Scripts Administrators, LLC, ESI Mail Pharmacy Service, Inc., Express Scripts Pharmacy, Inc., Express Scripts Specialty Distribution Services, Inc. and Medco Health Solutions, Inc..\n\nThe lawsuit was filed just a week after PBM representatives from Express Scripts Inc. were defending their roles as the middleman between pharmacies and drug manufacturers and drug benefit plan sponsors.

        "title": "How relationships have fueled the U.S. opioid crisis \u2014 Harvard Gazette",
        "authors": [
            "Elizabeth Zonarich"
        ],
        "text": "The U.S. opioid epidemic is a story of failed policy initiatives, missed opportunities, and more than 600,000 deaths. It\u2019s also a story with no end in sight, and for that, two economists say, we can blame relationships.\n\nThe central problem owes to the nature of the market, according to David Cutler, the Otto Eckstein Professor of Applied Economics at Harvard, and former Harvard doctoral student J. Travis Donahoe, co-authors of new research focused on the persistence of the crisis. In a situation with ample buyers and sellers \u2014 what economists call a \u201cthick market\u201d \u2014 spillovers in demand for opioids stem from the social nature of drug use, in which users encourage friends, acquaintances, and others to join them.\n\nThese demand-boosting spillover effects are common when the pleasure derived from a good is enhanced by shared moments, such as drinks at the bar or a group outing to a sporting event, said Cutler. The effects are particularly strong when the good is also highly addictive, he added.\n\nLike many others, Cutler has been horrified by the explosion of opioid abuse in the U.S., which in the 30 years covered by the study, 1990 to 2020, claimed more than a half million lives. At the same time, he\u2019s been puzzled by the epidemic\u2019s decades-long staying power, which far exceeds that of similar crises in U.S. history, including the crack epidemic of the 1980s.\n\nTrends in drug and opioid overdose deaths per 100,000, 1990 to 2020\n\nCutler and Donahoe, now an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, note in the study that communication via social networks becomes especially important in an illegal market, where advertising is unavailable and open sale is prohibited. In addition, they say, the presence of a robust market with many users can lower the nonmonetary costs of obtaining drugs, like risks from law enforcement or of violence from drug dealers, because the likelihood of doing business with friends, family members, and acquaintances rises.\n\nAccording to the analysts\u2019 economic models, \u201cspillovers\u201d were responsible for between 84 percent and 92 percent of opioid fatalities from 1990 to 2020, and were the chief reason for the steady climb in deaths. Without that spillover effect, they wrote, the opioid epidemic would have peaked in 2006. In contrast, rising demand due to spillovers can be high enough in some scenarios that, absent effective intervention, deaths rise indefinitely.\n\nBefore zeroing in on spillover effects, Cutler and Donahoe examined other potential explanations for the persistence of opioid demand in the U.S., including \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d factors such as physical and/or mental distress in the population. The pair, whose work is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, found a modest impact at most. From 1999 to 2018, the prevalence of physical pain in the population increased 20 percent, while opioid deaths increased 400 percent.\n\nA hypothetical opioid epidemic with and without spillovers\n\nSimilarly, the authors examined whether changes in supply might be sustaining the epidemic, which has been fueled at different moments by prescription opioids, illegal heroin, and, most recently, the synthetic opioid fentanyl. While supply has shifted significantly, Cutler and Donahoe point out that neither heroin nor fentanyl are new. Heroin has been around for more than a century and fentanyl for decades. It is the widespread use of these substances, not their availability, that has changed.\n\nIn addition, when the pair examined prices for illegal drugs, they found no evidence of a game-changer. Heroin prices remained relatively static even after the crackdown on prescription drugs, when more people sought out heroin. Similarly, fentanyl\u2019s displacement of heroin represented a major change to the opioid supply. But, while fentanyl is much cheaper to produce, the price on the street isn\u2019t that different from the price of heroin. This means that fentanyl makers are pocketing the difference rather than passing along savings to customers in a way that might boost demand, Cutler said.\n\nThe spillover effects at the heart of the epidemic are outgrowths of what economists call a \u201cthick market\u201d\u2014 in this case, one that developed early. Opioids have long been recognized as powerful painkillers but through most of the 20th century they were largely reserved for people with significant, acute pain, such as cancer patients. In the 1990s, prescribing practices shifted, so that the pain threshold dropped while the duration of use rose, creating a massive new market. One key driver was the time-release opioid OxyContin, which was promoted as safer and less addictive than other opioids. The rapid expansion of opioid prescribing created a veneer of safety and legality that increased societal acceptance of opioid use. Addiction was fed by \u201cpill mills,\u201d where prescriptions were written in volume.\n\nMap of average annual opioid deaths per 100,000, 1990 to 2018\n\n\u201cWhen the product is more readily available, other people use it more,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cThe way people would get their start is they\u2019d have some pain \u2014 back pain, knee pain \u2014 and they\u2019d be talking to friends and family and someone would say, \u2018Oh, when I had pain the doctor gave me opioids and I still have some in my medicine cabinet.\u2019 So, here\u2019s this prescription medication, and it\u2019s got to be safe and effective or the FDA wouldn\u2019t have let it out. The market is already there. I don\u2019t have to do anything illegal. I don\u2019t have to search very hard or go into the illegal market. The specific thing here is the availability. I can get it from friends, from family, from doctors who are prescribing it. That\u2019s the sense in which the thick market makes it really easy to start off.\u201d\n\nThe extraordinary potency of the drugs, he added, makes it extremely difficult to pull back.\n\n\u201cThese are very, very addicting substances,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cThey\u2019re hugely addicting. That really matters because the withdrawal gets to be extremely severe and the consequence of that is that there\u2019s a big issue in terms of people\u2019s absolute desire to go back and use again.\u201d\n\nCutler and Donahoe examined two pill-mill counties, one in Kentucky, the other in Ohio, where physicians prescribed opioids after cursory examinations, making them attractive for buyers interested in recreational use. The authors found that both physical proximity to the pill mill counties and social connectedness to people living in them raised the likelihood of opioid-related deaths. They found that every death in a pill mill county led to additional deaths in geographically close counties and in those with strong social connections to the pill mill counties, as measured by friend connections on Facebook.\n\nDistribution of social connectedness to Greenup County, Kentucky, and Scioto County, Ohio\n\nIn this kind of \u201cthick market\u201d situation, the authors concluded, even temporary misconduct or mistakes by regulators and suppliers can create harms that far outlast the mistake or misconduct. And in this case, Cutler said, the fault lies with just about everyone.\n\n\u201cCompanies got away with literally killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe DEA screwed up, the FDA screwed up, medical societies screwed up, rating agencies screwed up. There\u2019s enough blame to go around.\n\n\u201cIf somebody had done their job really well \u2014 the FDA, the DEA, pharma companies, distributors, pharmacies \u2014 if someone had stepped in and said, \u2018No, this is not right,\u2019 the epidemic would have been less bad.\u201d\n\nTo emphasize the point, he highlighted a missed opportunity amid the shift from prescription opioids to heroin. As authorities reacted to the damage of the growing crisis by tightening prescribing practices, they paid too little attention to demand. That failure to help, including a woefully inadequate commitment to treatment programs, led many people who were hooked on pills to turn to heroin.\n\n\u201cA big policy failure is that we thought too much about the supply side and not enough about the demand side,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cBy coupling the supply side with the demand side, you would not push people into the illegal market, even as you make it harder for new people to get opioids when they don\u2019t need them. Then, if you find a way for those who are addicted to get over the addiction, you\u2019ve reduced demand. You\u2019ve got a great glide path: fewer opioids out there, fewer new users, and help for those who are addicted.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that could still make a difference, he added \u2014 but only if we act on it.\n\n\u201cFor the good of society, we\u2019re treating opioids as more of a public health issue than a criminal issue. We got part of it right. There\u2019s no sense putting people who are addicted to heroin or fentanyl in jail. That\u2019s just dumb. But on the other hand, we can\u2019t not help them out. The sad part is that we haven\u2019t provided enough help.\u201d",

            "Russ Latino"
        ],
        "text": "Pharmacy benefits managers were designed to help lower prescription drug costs. In a new lawsuit, Mississippi AG Lynn Fitch alleges they colluded with drug manufacturers to sell addictive opioids.\n\nSince taking office, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch has participated in a series of national lawsuits and settlements with manufacturers, distributors, and marketers of opioids. On Thursday, Fitch filed a lawsuit in Hinds County Chancery Court identifying a new target: pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs).\n\nFitch\u2019s lawsuit alleges that PBMs colluded with opioid manufacturers to flood the market with cheap opioids, spurring an addiction crisis. The complaint describes the opioid crisis as the \u201cworst man-made epidemic in modern medical history,\u201d and one that \u201cravaged Mississippi.\u201d\n\nPharmacy benefits management was designed to reduce prescription drug costs for consumers. Because they work in conjunction with pharmacy networks that buy drugs in bulk, PBMs maintain leverage to negotiate lower prices and rebates with drug manufacturers. They also create \u201cformularies,\u201d which are approved drug lists designed to identify low-cost, preferred options for treating certain conditions.\n\nFitch\u2019s lawsuit alleges that two of the three largest PBMs in the country, Optum and Express Script, obtained rebates from opioid manufacturers that made opioids less expensive than safer alternatives. The complaint contends that as part of this rebate arrangement, PBMs agreed to list opioids on the formulary lists for pain management while ignoring safety concerns.\n\nThe Biden White House has targeted PBMs in recent years. The Federal Trade Commission, in July of this year, released a report arguing that PBMs have become anti-competitive because of industry consolidation and vertical integration with pharmacies and health insurance plans. U.S. House Republicans have also questioned the efficacy of PBMs in reducing drug costs in recent hearings.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s suit adopts some of these same arguments.\n\nIn a statement announcing the lawsuit, Fitch said the opioid epidemic is tearing apart families and community in Mississippi.\n\n\u201cI will continue to hold these companies accountable for the role that they have played in destroying so many lives through their unfair, deceptive practices so that our state can heal from this crisis and guard against it ever happening again,\u201d Attorney General Fitch said.\n\nFitch\u2019s office noted that over the past several years, the Attorney General has entered into settlements with more than a dozen companies \u2013 manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains, and even companies that created the marketing plans \u2013 that played a part in creating and amplifying the opioid crisis. In total, the AG said those lawsuits will bring north of $367 million to Mississippi over the next 18 years.\n\nThe Other Side\n\nAccording to the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), a trade association that represents PBMs, more than 275 million Americans have health insurance that includes PBM administered prescription drug plans, ranging from commercial health insurance to Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nPCMA estimates that PBMs negotiation of lower drug prices will save health plan sponsors and consumers more than $1 trillion on prescriptions over the next ten years. That works out to $1,040 annually for each patient and their insurance provider.\n\nThe industry also claims that formulary lists are developed on the recommendations of independent pharmacists, physicians and clinicians.\n\nFor instance, a white paper published by Express Script, one of the two PBMs named by Fitch, says its top consideration in developing its formulary list is the \u201cclinical appropriateness of the drug, not cost,\u201d and that its \u201cclinically sound formularies\u201d are \u201cbased on evaluations of independent physicians.\u201d\n\nIt also notes that \u201cthe prescribing physician always makes the final decision regarding an individual patient\u2019s drug therapy.\u201d",

        "authors": [
            "Dr. Nora Volkow"
        ],
        "text": "Saturday, August 31, is International Overdose Awareness Day, when we collectively remember those who have lost their lives to drug overdose, support those who grieve those losses, and offer encouragement to those who seek recovery from addiction. It is also an opportunity to share new knowledge about the overdose crisis and strategies for confronting it. There is some very good news this year: Provisional data from the CDC show that, overall, overdose deaths dropped by 7.5% in the 12 months ending March, 2024, the largest decline in decades. It is cause for optimism. But unfortunately, for some groups, we continue to see only greater escalation of the overdose crisis.\n\nA recent New York Times article highlighted the tragic epidemic of overdose deaths among older Black men in Baltimore. It is a city that has been especially hard-hit by the overdose crisis, but the trend is being seen nationwide. Although white and Black people use drugs at similar rates, fatal overdoses have escalated in Black people at a much higher rate than in other groups over the past decade, and multiple recent studies have documented especially high rates of overdose deaths among older Black men.\n\nFentanyl, often in combination with stimulants, is driving increased overdose deaths in most demographic groups. In all groups, men are at greater risk of overdose than women, but additional factors, including age-related health disparities, social isolation, and lifetime exposure to structural racism, may be colliding to produce the rise in overdoses among older Black men especially, and it points to the urgent need for intervention.\n\nA NIDA analysis found that between 2015 and 2023 (provisional data), there was a nearly 5-fold increase in overdose deaths among non-Hispanic Black men 55 and older (figure). In 2023, deaths in that demographic category were nearly triple the national average for that age group. The largest proportion of these deaths, and the steepest increases, involved fentanyl and cocaine. The overdose rate in older Black men is markedly higher than that for Black men overall.\n\nAn increase in drug use and drug problems is being seen in older people of all races and ethnicities. Over the past two decades, substance use treatment admissions have increased among people aged 50 and over. In older adults, the risk of problematic opioid use is raised by chronic illness, and pain may be an especially important factor. Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults, and treatment for pain is less effective in this age group than it is in younger people; it negatively impacts quality of life and is a risk factor for cognitive decline and premature death.\n\nAs people age, they may start to lose partners and social contacts. A recent National Academies report identified social isolation as a major contributing factor to illness and poor quality of life in older people; it particularly impacts men, who tend to have fewer social supports in later life than women. Loneliness and social isolation are well-known risk factors for substance use, and in an analysis of substance use patterns among older people with varying degrees of social connectedness and perceived loneliness, those who lived alone and felt lonely had the highest rates of nonmedical drug use. Although Black and Hispanic older adults have lower odds of social isolation than white older adults, as well as lower rates of alcohol use, one analysis of overdose deaths among middle-aged and older adults in Illinois identified a common profile of socially isolated, predominantly Black men who had alcohol in their system when they died.\n\nHealth and other social disparities likely contribute to escalating overdose rates among older Black men. Black people face discrimination and implicit bias in healthcare settings, including significantly longer wait times for emergency treatment of health problems. Black patients tend to be undertreated for pain, compared to white patients. Such discrimination goes along with other social determinants of health including under-resourced urban environments, housing instability, and food insecurity that may contribute to higher rates of premature mortality and a higher burden of chronic illnesses. Excess mortality from causes including heart disease, cancer, assault, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes is also higher among Black men.\n\nDiscrimination takes a toll on mental health. An analysis of data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found that discrimination against Black people was associated with higher odds of illicit drug use. Along with other minoritized groups like American Indians, Black people are less likely than white people to engage or remain in substance use treatment. Black people seeking addiction treatment face greater delays obtaining it than white people, and they are much less likely than white patients to be prescribed buprenorphine, which significantly reduces the risk of overdose death. Unfortunately, even when older Black people receive substance use treatment, they are more likely than their white counterparts to have their treatment terminated by a treatment facility.\n\nStructural discrimination is nothing new. The greater devastation fentanyl is wreaking in Black neighborhoods and communities like Baltimore could partly reflect longstanding patterns of economic disadvantage and mental health impacts of adversity\u2014a reemerging signal that had been temporarily drowned out by the white overdose deaths that dominated the statistics and the headlines during the first two decades of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death rates among older black men have been consistently higher than for any other racial/ethnic group of the same age and have accelerated just as fast if not faster than in other groups for nearly a decade.\n\nIn a widely cited 2015 paper, Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton argued that increased economic hardships for white people without college education in the years 1999-2013 contributed to increased mortality in this group from drug overdose, suicide, and alcohol-related liver disease\u2014what came to be called \u201cdeaths of despair.\u201d However, economic disadvantage has long been the reality for minoritized groups whose higher risks of addiction and its consequences were invisible or ignored. Until 2001, deaths from overdose among Black people were consistently much higher than in white people, yet in that era, the drug problem in Black communities was framed as a problem of crime and deviance, not legitimized through a lens like despair. Overdose rates among Black people again surpassed those for white people in 2020.\n\nThe tragic situation the New York Times highlighted in Baltimore appears to be a nationwide problem, and it is clearly a complex one with many intersecting factors at play. Research alone cannot solve it, but it is necessary to understand why the current dangerous illicit drug supply is disproportionately affecting this population. Is there more to it than the additive risk factors of being male, Black, and older? We also need to understand how the increased burden of potentially co-occurring health conditions, including pain, may affect overdose risk in this group, as well as how their opioid use may intersect with other substance use. Answering these questions can guide the development and implementation of prevention, treatment, and harm-reduction strategies tailored for these communities.\n\nHistorically, prevention research has mainly focused on children, adolescents, and young adults, but along with the rise in opioid-related overdoses in older individuals in most racial and ethnic groups, increased use of other drugs like cannabis in older adults highlights the need for different kinds of interventions. This could include interventions to prevent opioid misuse or the transition from use to misuse specifically in older adults taking opioids for chronic pain. It might also include public-health interventions aimed at addressing social isolation and loneliness in older people, which could have benefits for a wide range of physical and mental health outcomes beyond substance use and its consequences.\n\nUnderstanding structural factors affecting the health of underserved groups, both in the healthcare system and communities, is a primary objective of research that NIDA is funding as part of its Racial Equity Initiative. This research can help illuminate barriers to accessing substance use services in Black communities and inform the development of approaches to overcome them.\n\nNIDA\u2019s Intramural Research Program (IRP), which is located in Baltimore, is already leading several outreach and community-based research initiatives aimed at both better understanding and preventing fatal overdose in the city. For example, along with the Maryland Center for Health Equity at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, NIDA\u2019s IRP is partnering with community barbershops to offer overdose education and naloxone distribution in settings frequented and trusted by Black clients. Analysis of hair samples swept from the floors of these barbershops is being used to monitor the levels of fentanyl in these Baltimore neighborhoods in a completely anonymous manner\u2014a novel approach that could inform how interventions are targeted in these communities.\n\nEnding the overdose epidemic, especially for the hardest-hit groups like older Black men, will not be easy. It will require coordinated work involving health service providers, community coalitions, policy makers, and\u2014critically\u2014people with lived and living experience of substance use. Researchers, too, will be essential, both for developing new and improved interventions and demonstrating how they can be effectively deployed so that they reach the people who need them.",

        "text": "In 1987, the Partnership for a Drug-Free America launched an anti-narcotics campaign aimed at educating the public about the dangers of drug use. In the 30-second ad, an egg represented a person\u2019s brain and a hot frying pan represented drugs. The spokesman cracked the egg and poured it in the pan, causing the egg to fry.\n\nThe message was simple: \u201cThis is your brain on drugs\u201d\n\n\u201cThat commercial resonated with people, especially with teenagers\u201d said Greg Nevano, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Deputy Assistant Director, Illicit Trade, Travel and Finance Division. \u201cThe more education and public service announcements we can have out there teaching kids and parents [about the dangers of drugs], the better.\u201d\n\nFor law enforcement, the fight against narcotics continues. In 2016, nearly 30 years later, more than 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl and fentanyl analogues, and that number continues to rise. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. According to Drug Enforcement Administration estimates, one kilogram of fentanyl can produce 1 million to 1.5 million pill dosage units.\n\nIn the Internet age, accessibility and e-commerce has made the fight to combat opioids harder than ever. The typical dealer selling deadly opioids does not fit a specific profile, which is a challenge for law enforcement. Now, a dealer can be anyone with access to the Internet. Buyers can visit Dark Net sites anonymously using special browsers and make purchases with virtual currencies like Bitcoin, making transactions difficult to trace. In contrast, people who have been addicted to heroin need to go out and find street vendors and pushers and buy from them. With opioids, users can order from their living room and never go out to the street.\n\n\u201cThey can get their fix just by ordering it online for much cheaper and get a much more potent dosage. I think that\u2019s what the phenomenon is today,\u201d Nevano said. \u201cYou can search fentanyl and any other opioid, find it and order it online. It makes it very challenging because you don\u2019t need that middle person that law enforcement would normally target. The hierarchy of the traditional cartel structure is not there.\u201d\n\nCombating the Crisis\n\nIn Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, HSI seized nearly 2,400 pounds of fentanyl nationally. HSI has experienced a drastic increase in fentanyl related arrests and seizures in the last three years. As agency personnel have been working to combat this epidemic, one thing has become very clear \u2013 law enforcement can\u2019t arrest their way out of the problem. While the investigation, disruption and dismantling of transnational criminal organizations that illicitly introduce fentanyl, heroin and other dangerous opioids into the United States are chief among HSI\u2019s mission areas, it\u2019s only one step. An informed public, willing partners and engaged treatment and prevention community are also vital to combating the problem.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement can only play a certain role in it. There has to be many other facets to help stop this crisis,\u201d Nevano said. \u201cThere needs to be a whole of government approach.\u201d\n\nThe epidemic has become so bad that in October 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed an order declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency.\n\nIn his order, the president directed ICE to increase the number of Border Enforcement Task Forces (BEST), a primary resource utilized to attack this crisis. In FY 2017 HSI increased its BEST teams to 58. BESTs, along with High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA), Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) and Special Operations Division are all key components HSI relies on to strengthen efforts related to drug trafficking. BESTs leverage the participation of more than 1,000 federal, state, local and foreign law enforcement agents and officers representing over 100 law enforcement agencies that target opioid smuggling on a daily basis in both the international mail and express consignment channels.\n\n\u201cWhen the president comes out with an executive order and mandates that HSI prioritizes its investigative efforts in a particular area such as opioid interdiction, we must prioritize this request,\u201d Nevano said. \u201cSaving just one life is a success, but we can\u2019t just stop there. We need to aggressively continue to investigate and bring to justice those who are contributing to this epidemic.\u201d\n\nTo do its part, HSI has established a three-pronged approach to combating opioids:\n\nA Nationwide Epidemic\n\nThe opioid epidemic is not specific to one location, it\u2019s everywhere. Nearly every American community has been impacted by the crisis. The primary source of these drugs is China. According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, mass quantities of fentanyl are being produced in China and brought illegally to the United States, contributing to the growing crisis in the U.S. The rise of fentanyl in the United States can be traced back to China\u2019s large chemical and pharmaceutical industries, which manufacture vast quantities of the drug and its analogues to export to the western hemisphere with little regulatory oversight.\n\nBecause of the U.S. nexus to the border, and the mandate to enforce more than 400 federal statutes, ICE\u2019s role in the president\u2019s strategy starts well beyond the borders in an effort to prevent dangerous drugs and those engaged in the trafficking and distribution of contraband from reaching our shores. In order to continue the success of those initiatives and further seizures into identifying the criminal organizations responsible for the opioid crisis, HSI is streamlining its package interdiction efforts and working closely with law enforcement partners and intelligence centers.\n\n\u201cStopping these drugs from coming in is one of the biggest challenges we face. It requires the solicitation and cooperation from our international partners,\u201d Nevano said. \u201cThat\u2019s the end goal to do more with our international partners. We are trying to develop and build relationships with China to ensure that these opioids are controlled.\u201d\n\nIn working to combat the crisis, data allows investigators to identity the \u201chot spots,\u201d which are certain areas of the country where there are higher levels of overdose deaths. That\u2019s a sign that those areas that are afflicted with addiction.\n\nIn Ohio alone, unintentional drug-related overdoses caused the death of 4,050 residents in 2016. To address this deadly scourge, in Ohio, HSI completely shifted its investigative portfolio. In the last year, the agency tripled its focus on drug trafficking-related probes, which now account for more than 50 percent of all cases. HSI has doubled the number of special agents assigned to work these complex cases.\n\nBecause state and local officials don\u2019t always have the funding and resources, federal partners, like HSI, are often brought in to provide operational support and subject matter expertise. By tripling HSI\u2019s resources in a selected region, it further enhances the existing framework of law enforcement support in place. The reality is the more resources that are brought forth, the better the outcome for the communities most affected by opioids.\n\nNext Steps\n\n\u2018Why didn\u2019t we see this coming?\u2019\n\n\u2018What else is next?\u2019\n\n\u2018What is the next fentanyl out there?\u2019\n\nLaw enforcement officials face many questions when dealing with the opioid crisis. To face this epidemic now and in the future, HSI personnel have to be prepared. That preparation will require leveraging critical partnerships with state, local and federal partners to maximize its impact on the operation of transnational criminal organizations within various communities. Since October 2017, HSI has trained approximately 800 investigators around the country. During the week of March 12, HSI Detroit and ICE\u2019s Cyber Crimes Center will provide free Dark Net and Virtual Currencies training for more than 500 law enforcement personnel in Ohio and Michigan. The training will have an emphasis on illicit payment networks and financial transactions associated with fentanyl smuggling and distribution. By the end of FY 2018, HSI anticipates to train more than 1,500 investigators.\n\nSpreading the Word\n\nICE hosted a press conference March 16 with acting ICE Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director Thomas D. Homan and several elected officials from the state.\n\nPress Conference\n\nPresident Recognizes Critical Role of ICE\n\nHighlighting the major efforts the administration is dedicating to combating the opioid drugs crisis, President Donald J. Trump held a policy forum on \u201cOpioids: The Crisis Next Door\u201d at Manchester Community College on Monday, March 19, 2018 in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\nThe President recognized ICE agency efforts overall and specifically recognized HSI Manchester for its critical role as part of law enforcement efforts in the region along with key local, state and federal law enforcement partners in fighting the ongoing crisis.\n\nAmong those singled out for special recognition by the President included HSI Manchester Special Agents Derek Dunn and Ronald Morin for their roles in several highly-successful narcotics and human trafficking investigations in Massachusetts and in New Hampshire.\n\nAlso attending were local, state and federal law enforcement leadership engaged in the fight against the opioids crisis including DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, HSI-Boston Acting Special Agent In Charge Michael Shea, HSI- Boston Assistant Special Agent in Charge Bart Cahill, and HSI Manchester Resident Agent In Charge Michael Posanka.",

        "text": "Opioid use disorder and overdoses are preventable\n\nWhen we act early, we can prevent illegal substance use, including illegal opioids, and misuse of prescription medications, like opioids, that can lead to substance use disorders.\n\nSubstance use disorders, like opioid use disorder (OUD), impact communities across America. Prevention activities help educate and support individuals, families, and communities and are critical for maintaining both individual and community health.\n\nOpioid Use Disorder (OUD), sometimes referred to as \"opioid dependence\" or \"opioid addiction,\" is a problematic pattern of opioid use that causes significant impairment or distress. OUD is a medical condition that can affect anyone \u2013 regardless of race, gender, income level, or social class. Like many other medical conditions, evidence-based treatments are available for OUD, but seeking treatment remains stigmatized. Stigma can be a major barrier to how well prevention and treatment programs work amid the opioid crisis.\n\nOUD significantly contributes to overdose deaths among people who use illegal opioids or misuse prescription opioids. Opioids\u2014mainly synthetic opioids like illegally made fentanyl--are currently the most represented in overdose deaths.\n\nA recent study among 29 states and the District of Columbia showed the percentage of overdose deaths involving counterfeit pills more than doubled from July 2019 to December 2021, and more than tripled in the Western United States. These pills are dangerous because they typically appear as pharmaceutical pills but often contain illegally made fentanyl and illegal benzodiazepines or other drugs, with or without people's knowledge.\n\nFor every overdose that results in death, there are many more nonfatal overdoses, each one with its own emotional and economic toll.3 OUD and overdose deaths continue to be a major public health concern in the United States, but they are preventable.\n\nPeople can help reduce the risk of counterfeit pill overdose by:\n\nOnly taking pills prescribed to them\n\nBeing aware that pills bought illegally might contain highly potent drugs\n\nUsing fentanyl test strips (FTS), small strips of paper that can detect the presence of fentanyl in all different kinds of drugs (cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, etc.) and drug forms (pills, powder, and injectables)\n\nGet the facts",

        "text": "Naloxone has quickly become a central part of harm reduction efforts nationally and within North Carolina.\n\nThe medication comes in two main forms: an injection and nasal spray. Both work to save lives by reversing the effects of an opioid overdose.\n\nNaloxone is now widely carried by first responders and police. Distribution efforts have also helped make the medication available to community partners.\n\n\u201cHarm reduction is the first line of defense we have. It is the on the ground, in the community response. It is by people with lived experience for people with lived experience,\u201d shared Elyse Powell, executive director of the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition.\n\nEfforts to bring naloxone into school systems are also expanding, including in Wake County Schools. School officials tell WRAL News training efforts are underway to prepare for the distribution of the medication to schools this year.\n\nThursday, the NCHRC hosted an event at the Oberlin Regional Library bringing together national, state and local health officials to package opioid overdose rescue kits ahead of Overdose Awareness Day on Aug. 31.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen attended the event while in North Carolina this week. She explained efforts like these are urgently needed as opioid overdoses continue to impact families across the state.\n\n\u201cWe should not be losing anyone to overdose. We know what to do, we just need partners every day to keep doing the work,\u201d said Cohen.\n\nThe CDC director explained the kits packaged Thursday contained vials of naloxone, sealed syringes and administration instructions.\n\n\u201cWe want folks to use Narcan or Naloxone. The nasal is obviously easier, and the shot is one that gets into your system more effectively,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cThe important part is to have it on hand and know how to use it.\u201d\n\nPowell told WRAL News the kits will be distributed through the NCHRC\u2019s seven existing syringe service programs statewide. The goal is to get the medication directly into the hands of those known to use opioids.\n\nCohen further emphasized the need for continued harm reduction efforts saying addiction needed to be thought about and treated as a disease.\n\n\u201cJust like diabetes, we have medicine for that, we have medicines to treat addiction,\u201d shared Cohen.\n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein also attended Thursday\u2019s event to help package the overdose rescue kits.\n\nHe told WRAL News combating the opioid crisis requires a team effort.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is save lives. We want people to live healthy, happy lives,\u201d he shared. \u201cTo solve a problem like that, it requires partnership from the local government: we have Wake County here, the state: we have state representatives here including me, the federal government: CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen is here, and our nonprofit partners like the NCHRC.\u201d\n\nCohen agreed adding, \u201cThat is what North Carolina is doing so well - bringing communities together, bringing folks together to solve this hard problem.\u201d\n\nThe CDC director shared nationally, recent stats have pointed to some positive news.\n\n\u201cNationally, we\u2019re making progress. For the first time last year, we saw the first decrease in overdose deaths,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nThe CDC director further elaborated more work needs to be done as 100,000 Americans are still dying annually from overdoses.\n\nCohen and Stein both expressed the biggest contributing factor to the rise in overdose deaths over the years is fentanyl.\n\n\u201cWe actually have the same amount of overdoses, but they\u2019re just becoming more deadly,\u201d noted Cohen. \u201cIt only takes one time for you to take something that you don\u2019t know fentanyl is in there, for it to take your life.\u201d\n\nStein shared he recently spoke with a family just this week who lost a loved one to an overdose.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely devastating. We have to do everything we can to tackle the fentanyl crisis,\u201d added Stein. \u201cThat means reducing demand by reducing the people who need drugs, but it also means reducing supply, stopping fentanyl from coming at the border and breaking up the drug trafficking rings that operate here in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nPowell added the allocation of over $1 billion in opioid settlement funding to organizations throughout the state will hopefully help other grassroots efforts grow.\n\n\u201cThe data is looking like so far in North Carolina, we\u2019re on track to see a reduction in overdoses this year. That is because of the historic investment we\u2019ve made in harm reduction,\u201d shared Powell.\n\nShe continued, \u201cI think it\u2019s really critical as we look to further invest these dollars to make sure we\u2019re both prioritizing the things we know work: harm reduction, naloxone distribution, evidence-based treatment, and we\u2019re making sure we\u2019re bringing in the voices of the people this epidemic has impacted the most.\u201d\n\nThe NCHRC leader shared those with lived experiences should have a voice in how opioid settlement funding is used within communities.",

        "text": "Education\n\nCalifornia has pursued several public education campaigns, including a youth opioid education and awareness campaign, with an emphasis on fentanyl awareness.\n\nAdditionally, the Campus Opioid Act, signed by Governor Newsom in 2022, requires that every public college campus in California distribute a federally approved opioid overdose reversal medication like naloxone, and include information about opioid overdoses in their orientation process. Building on this effort, Governor Newsom signed AB 2429 (Alvarez), mandating fentanyl education be included in health classes.\n\nLast year, the Governor launched opioids.ca.gov \u2013 a comprehensive website with resources for Californians. The website serves as a reliable source of information on prevention, data, treatment, and support where Californians can also access information related to the state\u2019s use of opioid settlement funds and efforts to hold drug-traffickers accountable.\n\nPrevention\n\nThe state has gone well beyond education, taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to the overdose crisis. A history of racial and economic disparities have helped drive the opioid crisis, heavily impacting access to lifesaving medications and treatments. Recognizing that, California is working to ensure that those most in need of support and help can access the necessary resources to help themselves and their loved ones and help prevent overdose-related deaths.\n\nEarlier this year, the Governor announced the launch of a CalRx\u00ae-branded over-the-counter (OTC) naloxone HCL nasal spray, 4 mg, which is available for free to eligible organizations through the Naloxone Distribution Project (NDP). This follows the state\u2019s contract with Amneal Pharmaceuticals to purchase an OTC naloxone nasal spray product through CalRx\u00ae\u2019s Naloxone Access Initiative at a significantly lower price. Through the NDP, the state has distributed more than 4 million kits, saving more than 285,000 lives.\n\nCalifornia is also focused on getting drugs, including illicit fentanyl, off the streets and out of California\u2019s neighborhoods. Last year, Governor Newsom expanded the California National Guard\u2019s work to prevent drug trafficking by transnational criminal organizations, launching a Counter Drug Task Force that operates across the state. The task force has been invaluable in helping federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies \u2013 seizing 8 million pills in the first six months of 2024.\n\nEmerging threats\n\nCalifornia is closely monitoring emerging threats that may become the next phase of the opioid crisis \u2013 including fentanyl being cut with xylazine, or mixed with illicit stimulants like methamphetamine or cocaine. The state provides a number of different resources that address these threats, that has resulted in almost half a million patients that have been referred for or received any recovery support services.\n\nXylazine \u2013 also known as \u201ctranq\u201d \u2013 is an animal tranquilizer that has reached the US illicit drug supply, and has been linked to an increasing number of overdose deaths nationwide. Right now, there is no evidence to suggest that xylazine is common in California\u2019s drug supply, and Governor Newsom has taken early and aggressive steps to keep it that way. The California Department of Public Health works closely with partners across the state to monitor and address current trends and threats, and has issued a letter notifying all health facilities of the danger posed by and signs of xylazine exposure.\n\nLast November, Governor Newsom called for legislative action to increase criminal penalties for the illicit trafficking of xylazine, and despite setbacks in the Legislature, he will continue to work with Legislative partners to pass this law.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe opioid crisis has evolved over several decades, going through several phases since 1999, and killing over 564,000 people in the United States from overdose deaths alone. Fentanyl began to grow more popular in 2013, due to its potency and relative cheapness \u2013 which sent overdose deaths skyrocketing. Over 150 people die every day because of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.",

        "text": "Today, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), announced the 2024 State Opioid Response (SOR) and Tribal Opioid Response (TOR) Notices of Funding Opportunity, providing up to $1.48 billion to states, territories, and the District of Columbia and $63 million to Tribes to address the overdose crisis in fiscal year 2024. This funding is a critical investment in the President Biden\u2019s Unity Agenda for the nation, and supports evidence-based, holistic practices that address the overdose crisis, including prevention, harm reduction, treatment such as the use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), naloxone and other opioid overdose reversal medications, and recovery supports.\n\n\u201cState and Tribal Opioid Response grants provide essential support in the fight against the overdose crisis,\u201d said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. \u201cThis funding is aligned with the HHS Overdose Prevention Strategy and allows states and Tribes to build critical infrastructure and increase capacity in ways that fit their unique needs. The Administration is committed to bolstering the implementation of evidence-based practices that save lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder President Biden\u2019s Unity Agenda, we have made historic investments to expand access to life-saving treatments, services, and overdose reversal medications across the nation,\u201d said White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director Dr. Rahul Gupta. \u201cThese State and Tribal Opioid Response grants will support critical local efforts in our whole-of-society response to address the overdose epidemic and save lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Biden made it a top priority of his Unity Agenda to ensure states, Tribes and territories have the tools and evidence-based strategies needed to beat the overdose crisis,\u201d said Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm. \u201cAt HHS, we believe there should be no wrong door for people who are seeking support and care to manage their behavioral health challenges, including when it comes to getting treatment for substance use disorder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe State and Tribal Opioid Response funding are some of SAMHSA\u2019s largest grants and will continue expanding access to care for those in the greatest need and in the most overlooked communities,\u201d said Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. \u201cThese grants enable states, territories, and Tribal entities to fund programs that support the continuum of prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery for millions of people. Thanks to this funding, many more lives will be saved.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 SOR funding opportunity includes initiatives to:\n\nBuild on opioid overdose reversal medication (naloxone and nalmefene) saturation efforts, ensuring these medications are in the hands of those most likely to witness an overdose.\n\nIncrease the focus on the full continuum of prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services for transitional aged youth and young adults (ages 16-25).\n\nExpand access to MOUD in correctional settings.\n\nEmphasize the provision of services using a whole-person approach, taking into account an individual\u2019s physical and mental health needs and their social supports.\n\nSOR awards will help states and territories build on successes from previous grants. From 2018 to 2023, SOR recipients have reported:\n\nOver 550,000 overdose reversals\n\nAbout 9.8 million naloxone kits and 7 million fentanyl test strips distributed\n\nOver 1.2 million people received treatment services and over 600,000 people received MOUD, including buprenorphine, methadone, and injectable extended-release naltrexone.\n\nAt their six month follow up, 78% of people who received treatment through SOR reported they did not use illicit drugs.\n\nTOR awards will also help Tribal communities continue to build on successes since 2018, including:\n\nProviding treatment and recovery support to over 11,000 people\n\nDistributing almost 50,000 naloxone kits and 37,000 fentanyl test strips\n\nFurnishing prevention resources to over 78,000 people.\n\nIn order to help recipients better plan and implement overdose response activities, SOR awards will be extended from two to three years, and TOR awards will be extended from two to five years.\n\nOver the past three years, under President Biden\u2019s leadership, the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments, taken unprecedented action, and removed decades-long barriers to substance use disorder treatment and overdose reversal medication to help address the overdose epidemic and save lives.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

        "text": "As a vital component of our community outreach efforts, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office is providing age-appropriate educational presentations for students in all age ranges, from elementary school through graduate school. The topics covered include the dangers of opioid abuse, the scope of the problem, what to do in the event of an overdose, and treatment options for persons suffering from addiction. Upon request, we will assemble experts that includes public health and law enforcement officials, and/or addiction specialists. We will work with you to assemble the program that best fits the needs of your student population.\n\nOur events include, in addition to a panel discussion, a screening of the FBI/DEA film, \"Chasing the Dragon: The Life of an Opiate Addict,\" which illustrates the stark reality of opioid addiction.\n\nThis crisis is being driven primarily by opioids\u2014prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic drugs like fentanyl.\n\nBut we cannot arrest and prosecute our way out of a problem that is deeply rooted in many communities. Enforcement efforts must be paired with education and rehabilitation for those who have fallen into addiction. As such, we are committed to addressing the opioid abuse problem with prevention and treatment options.\n\nWhile public discussions can shed light on the opioid epidemic, real education is rooted in one-on-one conversations in homes and communities. Families should have meaningful conversations about the dangers of prescription drug abuse because the threat is real. Communities need to come together to address the issue because opioid abuse affects everyone.\n\nAccording to the New England Journal of Medicine, in the United States we are seeing more availability, higher purity, and lower price. Dealers are lacing heroin and cocaine with fentanyl\u2014a drug 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin\u2014and they are making counterfeit prescription drugs that in fact are made from fentanyl. As a result, the drugs on the street are now more powerful, more addictive, and more dangerous than ever. And they\u2019re not just dangerous for users: even being accidently exposed to just a few grains of fentanyl can kill a police officer or paramedic.\n\nLos Angeles County is facing a public health crisis stemming from the abuse of prescription drugs such as OxyContin and Vicodin, as well as the increased use of heroin and fentanyl. We are not alone. In 2017, more than 72,000 Americans died from drug overdoses. Of those deaths, more than 60,000 were from prescription and street opioids. Millions more in the United States are abusing prescription painkillers. In Los Angeles County, over the past 10 years, opioids have been present in more than 5,000 deaths, which is well over 80 percent of all drug-related deaths in the county. But the deaths tell only part of story of the opioid epidemic, which also has inflicted a tremendous emotional and financial toll on addicts and their families, and on communities throughout the country.\n\nAs we go out into local communities to discuss this public health threat, we are highlighting a multi-prong approach designed to save lives and reduce the terrible impact these drugs have on the lives of our family members and fellow citizens.\n\nAt the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, we have been committed to stemming the flow of illegal drugs for many years. Our enforcement efforts have helped reduce the availability of opioids on the street and have had a deterrent effect.\n\nTogether we can adopt new strategies to confront the opioid epidemic, spare many families the pain of living through addiction, and save many lives in the process.\n\nFor information or to schedule a presentation, please contact: USACAC.CommunityOutreach@usdoj.gov.",

        "text": "Overdoses are devastating communities across the United States, from small towns to big cities. Sonoma County is no exception. On Overdose Awareness Day, the county is acknowledging the profound impact of the opioid crisis. Drug overdoses have surged by over 60% since 2015, largely driven by opioids. In 2023, opioids were involved in 80% of all overdoses in the county.\n\nFentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, has made the crisis even deadlier. Last year, fentanyl was present in 90% of opioid-related overdoses, contributing to 91 out of 131 overdose deaths in Sonoma County. County officials point to several factors fueling this epidemic, including genetic predispositions, mental health challenges, and economic hardships like homelessness and inflation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a perfect storm that leads to addiction,\u201d says Will Goowski, who manages substance use disorder services for Sonoma County\u2019s Behavioral Health Division. \u201cIt\u2019s not just one issue; it\u2019s a mix of stressors and a lack of support pushing people toward substance use.\u201d\n\nGoowski shared these insights on the \u201cSOCO Chat\u201d podcast, hosted by Matt Brown, deputy communications manager for the county of Sonoma. Starting Dec. 1, the county will roll out the Drug Medi-Cal Organized Delivery System, which will expand access to vital services like residential treatment and care coordination. This new system aims to offer comprehensive support for those struggling with substance use disorders, ensuring they get the help they need more easily.\n\nIncreasing access to Narcan\n\nTo combat the rising number of overdoses, Sonoma County is making Narcan, an overdose-reversal drug, more accessible. The county is working with local organizations to provide Narcan training and plans to install vending machines with Narcan and fentanyl testing strips in high-risk areas.\n\n\u201cNarcan saves lives, and we want it available to everyone who needs it,\u201d Goowski explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a straightforward, effective way to prevent fatal overdoses.\u201d\n\nEvents promote awareness and support\n\nCome out for Overdose Awareness Day tonight from 6 to 9 p.m. at 1430 Neotomas Ave. in Santa Rosa. The event will feature personal stories from community members affected by the crisis, a commemorative art installation, and a candlelight vigil to honor those lost to overdoses.\n\nJoin \u201cRecovery Happens\u201d on Sept. 20 at Rincon Valley Community Park. Celebrate recovery journeys and community resilience with activities like painting, games, and workshops focused on mental health and substance use disorders.\n\nDespite the grim statistics, county officials remain hopeful. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to tackling this crisis with everything we\u2019ve got,\u201d says Goowski. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work ahead, but with more resources and community support, we believe we can make a difference.\u201d",

        "text": "Twenty-two high school-age kids died each week from overdoses in 2022, according to research from UCLA. Twenty-two! Many of these deaths could have been prevented had witnesses been carrying naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal treatment that is now available over the counter.\n\nIf you know me, you know that the number 22 has held significance in my life for many years now, as I wore the number on my jersey during my professional football career. Perhaps that is why this statistic caught my attention. As a father of five young adult children, this truth hit me hard, but it also fueled me to continue raising naloxone awareness and inspiring action, as I hope it will for others.\n\nOpioid overdose continues to be the leading cause of accidental death in the U.S., affecting hundreds of thousands of people each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In recent years, significant progress has been made and tools have been implemented to combat the opioid epidemic, such as over-the-counter approval and availability of naloxone, often sold under the brand name Narcan Nasal Spray. While new data shows a modest reduction in overdose deaths year over year, more than 100,000 Americans are still dying each year from drug overdose \u2014 8 in 10 \u2014 the majority caused by opioids like heroin and fentanyl.\n\nIn honor of International Overdose Awareness Day this Saturday, I want to first acknowledge the mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, neighbors and communities that have suffered the loss of a loved one. I\u2019ve lost many people in my life to opioid overdose, and the grief is real. This is why I am encouraging more conversation about opioid overdose and calling for greater access to naloxone, to help increase the ability for us all to potentially save a life by carrying naloxone and knowing how to use it.\n\nThe threat of an accidental opioid overdose is very real, especially for teens, college students and young adults, studies show. Rates of opioid misuse and dependency are highest among young adults ages 18 to 25. Parents like me are concerned by these numbers. A recent survey by Bryter Inc. revealed that 9 in 10 parents believe that normalizing the topic of opioid overdose and reversal treatments like naloxone could help save lives, and that a more robust national conversation could be part of the solution. Additionally, 90% agree that schools, public libraries, dorms and professionals who work with teens and college kids should have access to naloxone.\n\nI\u2019m particularly passionate about this issue not only as a father, but also given my connection to opioid overdose \u2014 through my experience playing professional football but also in my personal life. During my 15-year career, I saw the immense impact opioids can have in the sports community. I saw promising athletes turn to opioids as a result of injuries, and I lost teammates to accidental overdose. Close family members of mine have also been affected and have developed opioid dependencies after receiving medical care.\n\nAs an athlete, I would train year-round to make sure I was ready for the season \u2014 every game, every snap. My mantra has always been if you stay ready, you don\u2019t have to get ready. The same mentality should apply to addressing the opioid overdose crisis. The reality is accidental overdoses can happen anywhere, anytime, and I want people to remember that small measures like keeping naloxone in your home or carrying it on the go could mean the difference between life or death.\n\nThe challenge seems intimidating, but simple actions can have a meaningful impact, and I encourage everyone to get smarter on opioid risks. When I wanted to get ready for a game, I would prepare, prepare, prepare. This is no different. One great resource to get prepared is the Ready to Rescue initiative, which I am honored to partner with. Ready to Rescue provides information and resources targeted at college students and their parents. Notably, it provides commonsense steps \u2014 including where to pick up naloxone and how to use it \u2014 that each of us can take to be ready for and hopefully prevent a deadly overdose.\n\nTaking personal responsibility to be prepared is an important step and will require a team effort. As with all teams, we need support from coaches, administrators and team executives in order to succeed. In the case of America\u2019s opioid crisis, we need overdose reversal treatment manufacturers, lawmakers, retailers, business owners, school districts and insurance providers to step up and provide the necessary education, awareness, accessibility and affordability to make naloxone as ubiquitous as lip balms and hand sanitizers.\n\nWhile naloxone is one key component in taking a stand against this public health threat, it doesn\u2019t end there. We all have a responsibility whether it\u2019s getting prepared, creating an open dialogue around this issue, or making changes, both big and small, in our daily lives to see the difference we want to see in our communities. I\u2019m calling upon everyone to do their part so we can make a safer world for our children and future generations.\n\nEmmitt Smith is an NFL Hall of Famer and a former running back for the Dallas Cowboys.

        "text": "Overlooking a sea of more than 22,000 purple flags planted on Boston Common signifying the toll of the opioid crisis in Massachusetts, Dana DiSenso reflected Thursday on her own journey to recovery as she urged state lawmakers to pass legislation that would enable cities and towns to open overdose prevention centers.\n\nDiSenso, who will soon reach six years in recovery from substance use disorder, said she cannot even count on one hand how many friends she\u2019s lost to overdose deaths. There was one year when she lost more than a dozen people and couldn\u2019t make it to every funeral, said DiSenso, who now works as a peer support patient navigator in New Bedford.\n\n\u201cI truly think getting the overdose prevention centers is the most important thing we could do at this point -- having a place where people know that they can go to use safely because people are going to use no matter what,\u201d DiSenso said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in needle exchange programs, and I\u2019ve watched people come in and get safe supplies and build rapport with the folks working there to the point where they were able to feel safe, to ask for help, to go to treatment. I have friends that are alive because of safe needles, because of Narcan, because of utilizing those programs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople \u201cdon\u2019t have to die before they can find recovery,\u201d DiSenso added, as she stood beside the heartrending display of fluttering purpled flags planted by the Department of Public Health, Boston Medical Center and people affected by the opioid epidemic. There are a total of 22,125 flags, representing lives lost to overdoses from 2012 to 2023, a DPH spokesperson said.\n\nMassachusetts has recorded more than 2,000 opioid-related overdose fatalities each year since 2016.\n\nThe flags, planted Thursday morning ahead of International Overdose Awareness Day on Saturday, will be on display through Sept. 1, according to BMC. Visitors can place stickers on flags in honor of loved ones lost to overdoses and decorate rocks for a rock garden memorial, BMC said.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the State House, the massive display also poignantly hints at unfinished business on Beacon Hill, where lawmakers ran out of time at the end of formal sessions to strike a compromise on addiction and substance use disorder legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike the House, the Senate approved a controversial policy -- which is supported by DPH -- that would enable municipalities to open safe injection sites, where trained professionals can intervene and prevent overdoses as people use pre-acquired, illicit substances.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in need for policy that is going to support people in recovery and support people who are actively using,\u201d DPH Commissioner Robbie Goldstein told the News Service when asked about the stalled legislation. \u201cAnd there are ways to do that through the State House, and I think we continue to want to work with our colleagues in the Legislature to get a bill over the finish line and get that out. But our Bureau of Substance Addiction Services is doing this work every day, and we\u2019re going to continue to do the work and push forward with the policy that we know is going to save lives, and protect people, and get people into care.\u201d\n\nEven without legislative action, Goldstein said DPH is able to boost access to recovery coaches and deploy harm reduction services. DPH in June said officials had distributed more than 196,500 naloxone kits since 2023, in addition to more than 504,000 free fentanyl test strip kits to providers and community organizations.\n\nNew York City is already home to two overdose prevention centers, which are technically illegal under federal law. DiSenso pointed out a center is also slated to open in Rhode Island.\n\n\u201cIf all these other places can do it, so can we,\u201d DiSenso said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s just important for lawmakers to keep the focus on the lives of all the residents of Massachusetts, including people that use drugs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs she looked at the purple flags, Deirdre Calvert, director of the Bureau of Substance Addiction Services, said it breaks her heart that \u201cwe are still having this amount of deaths.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe declared a public health emergency in 2014 under Deval Patrick, and during that time, we\u2019ve lost more than 20,000 individuals to overdose -- really, in my opinion, due to stigma, discrimination and overly aggressive federal policies in some respects,\u201d Calvert said.\n\nWho should carry Narcan, now available over-the-counter",

        "authors": [
            "david rogers"
        ],
        "text": "Opioid addiction is one of America\u2019s most daunting public health crises. It spans every class, race, and geographic location. It has affected millions of people in the last 30 years, and there is still no end in sight: According to the Centers for Disease Control, 2021 was the first year that overdose deaths in the United States exceeded 100,000 people, and more than 80,000 of the cases were opioid-related. The same bleak numbers held last year.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to untangle the opioid epidemic from the ongoing legacy of the War on Drugs. For decades, the most common response to substance abuse was criminalization, and even today, it\u2019s possible for individuals to face decades in prison for drug possession, even though incarceration heightens the potential harms and dangers of addiction. People newly released from prison, who face a risk of death 12 times higher than other individuals in their first two weeks of freedom, are most likely to die from a drug overdose.\n\nPrisons expose a greater problem shared across America, too: a profound lack of public health and harm reduction services for people struggling with substance abuse. Nationwide, only 20% of adults with opioid addiction received medication in 2021, and 64% went without any treatment. Many people\u2014especially people of color, women, and those in rural areas like Appalachia\u2014face deeply entrenched barriers to effective treatment and recovery services, including poverty, lack of access to health care, and lack of reliable public transportation. And while opioid addiction touches every corner of society, it compounds issues that affect society\u2019s most vulnerable, including economic insecurity and homelessness.\n\nThankfully, around the U.S., social justice leaders are rethinking related systems and challenging the prejudices that keep opioid addiction and the criminal justice system so tightly entangled. These advocates and organizations are working in partnership with local governments and in their communities, using their deep understanding of how the opioid crisis has harmed people to get resources directly to those who need it most\u2014saving lives and trying to take short-sighted punishments out of the equation.\n\nIn Kentucky, one of the states hit hardest by overdose deaths, the government and advocates are building significant change. In July 2021, after more than 3,000 state and local governments started pursuing opioid makers and distributors to recover billions of dollars in taxes related to the epidemic, a coalition of attorneys general announced that they had reached a $26 billion settlement with manufacturer Johnson & Johnson and three opioid distributors to resolve legal claims. Kentucky received $478 million from this and allocated half to county and local governments, and a growing number are working closely with community-based and public health partners in their research and policy decisions. Vital Strategies, a public health nonprofit that Ford supports, works with Kentucky officials to get the overdose reversal drug naloxone into more communities statewide, help develop programs and best practices for deploying mobile harm reduction vans into underserved areas, and conduct surveys of syringe services programs to help strengthen services, which include sterile syringes and safer use supplies, counseling, and health testing and treatment connections for drug users.\n\nIn order to advance public health approaches to overdose prevention, advocates are forming new connections and breaking out of their silos. \u201cBoth government and community groups have essential roles to play,\u201d says Daliah Heller, vice president of drug use initiatives at Vital Strategies. \u201cBuilding trust and relationships between community-based partners and health and government agencies is not only leading to stronger collaboration but more effective solutions.\u201d\n\nWhile Vital Strategies works with government, community-based groups that Ford supports\u2014such as the Foundation for Appalachian Kentucky and VOCAL-Kentucky\u2014are working at the county and local levels to help Kentuckians impacted by addiction generate new solutions and build bridges between rural and urban communities. VOCAL describes its 120-county strategy as one that reaches \u201cfrom the hood to the holler,\u201d and it relies on coalition-building, organizing, and public education to build a healthier, more just society. VOCAL\u2019s members mobilized for and attended every one of the Opioid Abatement Community Town Halls, which were designed to gather input on how the state and counties should use hundreds of millions of settlement dollars.\n\nIn addition to organizing, VOCAL hasn\u2019t shied away from providing services and direct support to people who need them. \u201cSince our recent opening of our office in Louisville, we have already become a critical community space for respite and care in an area extremely hard hit by overdose, homelessness, and disinvestment,\u201d says ,\u201d says Shameka Parrish-Wright, Executive Director of VOCAL Kentucky. \u201cOur office presents a vision of what we hope to win across the city: a caring space grounded in harm reduction that meets people where they are.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Foundation for Appalachian Kentucky (FAKY) is grappling with a region devastated by both the opioid epidemic and heavy criminalization of it, which has driven a 250% increase in the jail population in Eastern Kentucky in the past two decades. FAKY builds homegrown solutions in rural communities and emphasizes a shift toward prevention, rather than punishment. In partnership with regional legal services agency Appalred Legal Aid, they developed Project Renew, a reentry support pilot project that connects people to critical resources such as housing, transportation, and treatment, while also providing legal support to minimize barriers to reentry success.\n\n\u201cThe project started in a single county jail and then expanded to include folks in addiction recovery centers around the region,\u201d says Amelia Kirby, director of the Sycamore Fund at FAKY, \u201cThe model was so successful that funds from the Opioid Abatement Settlement Fund have been granted to implement Project Renew across the state.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been setbacks\u2014including legislation passed this year that further criminalizes addiction and ignores its root causes\u2014community leaders such as these give us many reasons to hope for a better future. The coalitions and partnerships that they\u2019ve established\u2014and the defenses they mount against harmful proposals that continue opioid criminalization and keep people trapped in cycles of poverty, substance abuse, and incarceration\u2014will create the roadmap for the next generation. Expanding services like mobile harm reduction resource vans, counseling and treatment services, and vibrant recovery communities have a meaningful impact in peoples\u2019 lives, no matter where they are on their recovery journey.\n\nRelated Grantees",

        "text": "Well before prescribers firmly understood the addictive power of opioids, Rich Jermyn, D.O., knew something was terribly wrong.\n\nA pioneer in pain management and addiction medicine, Jermyn treated chronic pain among HIV/AIDS patients in his clinic at what is now Rowan-Virtua School of Osteopathic Medicine (SOM) in Stratford. He knew his patients well. So, when many developed an ever-increasing need for the opioids he was prescribing, he recognized two things: The medications weren\u2019t as safe for long-term use as its makers had advertised. And the fallout would require an immense effort to repair.\n\nThe opioid epidemic has since claimed people across every age, race and socioeconomic demographic. Even as opioid prescriptions have plummeted, deaths due to opioid use disorder (OUD) have continued to soar in the United States as powerful synthetic fentanyl flows into the illegal market, accounting for 75 percent of drug overdose deaths in 2021 alone.\n\n\u201cSubstance use disorder will never get better until we start looking at addiction as a disease like diabetes and hypertension,\u201d said Jermyn, dean of Rowan-Virtua SOM and founder of its NeuroMusculoskeletal Institute (NMI), both in the Virtua Health College of Medicine & Life Sciences.\n\n\u201cIt's just a new HIV from a stigma perspective,\u201d said Jermyn. \u201cThe reason opioid addiction isn't being treated better than it is right now is because people think it's a moral failing. It's not. It's a mental health disease and we have treatments for it.\u201d\n\nTo address the crisis, researchers and physicians across Rowan University\u2019s campuses are working with partner health systems to discover new treatments, train the next generation of providers and find new strategies to help people access treatment and recover. Below is just a sample of the research underway.\n\nThe work, Jermyn said, is mission-critical.\n\nNew frontiers\n\nResearchers in the Department of Cell Biology & Neuroscience at the Rowan-Virtua School of Translational Biomedical Engineering & Sciences and the Rowan-Virtua SOM are working to map the brain mechanisms involved in opioid-reward and opioid-seeking behaviors, information that could one day lead to the development of new treatments, therapies or prescribing practices.\n\nEarly work by behavioral neuroscientists Dan Manvich, Ph.D., and Jessica Loweth, Ph.D., has shown that both drug reinforcement and drug craving for prescription painkillers varies during the rodent reproductive cycle, an understudied area of addiction research they hope to explore further.\n\n\u201cThere are findings that, generally speaking, females might be more sensitive to certain aspects of addiction than males,\u201d Loweth said.\n\nSpecifically, fluctuating hormones across the reproductive cycle are known to influence craving and relapse. Loweth\u2019s work focuses on how ovarian hormones may affect receptor signaling within the neuronal reward circuitry. Such information could help identify therapeutic targets to reduce craving and promote abstinence in recovering users.\n\nIn another line of inquiry supported by the New Jersey Health Foundation, Manvich is collaborating with researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to understand how new compounds for the treatment of opioid use disorder are able to reduce the effects of opioids in the brain.\n\n\u201cIf we can understand how these drugs are exerting their therapeutic effects,\u201d Manvich said, \u201cthen we can design improved compounds that do it best\u2014optimally maximizing the beneficial effects and minimizing the unwanted side effects.\u201d\n\nStress, anxiety could affect susceptibility\n\nStress neurobiologist Dan Chandler, Ph.D., explores how the brain responds to stress and how the brain, specifically the area called the locus coeruleus, generates anxiety in response to stress.\n\nThe brain\u2019s naturally occurring opioids, primarily endorphin and enkephalin, bind to receptors in the locus coeruleus, calming anxiety. Chronic stress decreases the levels of opioid receptors in that part of the brain and could prime the brain for a more permanent state of anxiety. As part of a NIDA-funded research collaboration, Chandler and Manvich are studying the effects of opioids on a stressed brain.\n\n\u201cBecause stress reduces the brain\u2019s ability to respond to natural opioids, these more potent abused opioids might become more rewarding because they\u2019re reducing the anxiety that\u2019s caused by stress,\u201d Chandler said.\n\nThrough NIDA-funded rodent studies, behavioral neuroscientist Elizabeth West, Ph.D., is building on her research on cocaine and decision-making to determine if opioids impair decision-making abilities. She\u2019s also examining whether an individual\u2019s decision-making behavior can predict elevated opioid use.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in susceptibility, vulnerability and resiliency,\u201d West said.\n\nUltimately, researchers hope to find a method for determining which patients are at higher risk of developing opioid use disorder.\n\nTaking it to the street\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to have treatments available. It\u2019s another to get them to the people who need them most.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to meet the patients where they're at,\u201d said Jermyn. \u201cThat includes addiction.\u201d\n\nAs part of its mission to treat the underserved, Rowan-Virtua SOM uses $22 million in extramural funding largely to reach marginalized populations and find creative ways to address health care disparities in southern New Jersey.\n\nDuring the COVID pandemic, for example, Jermyn marshaled a mobile unit to deliver Suboxone to people with opioid use disorder and COVID vaccines to unhoused populations.\n\nOther grants support suicide prevention among veterans; \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d programs to promote the use of Narcan in communities with high rates of opioid overdoses; and virtual courses to teach New Jersey doctors how to manage opioid-dependent patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not only treating the substance use disorder, but we\u2019re actually treating the patient,\u201d Jermyn said. \u201cThis might be the first time that they\u2019ve had any medical evaluation. And we find a host of chronic conditions that are being untreated.\n\n\u201cThis is why we\u2019re out in the community,\u201d Jermyn said. \u201cIt\u2019s boots on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u2018Fast and furious\u2019\n\nWhile synthetic opioids like fentanyl have accounted for the majority of drug overdose deaths in recent years, adulteration of fentanyl with the animal tranquilizer xylazine has emerged as a major public health concern that is complicating resuscitation and recovery options.\n\nBut investigators aren\u2019t giving up.\n\n\u201cA particular challenge with xylazine-containing fentanyl is that Narcan seems to be less effective for counteracting overdose, but the research is coming fast and furious,\u201d said Manvich, who is closely following studies characterizing the effects of xylazine-fentanyl combinations.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of outstanding researchers working to address these questions,\u201d he added. \u201cAs long as the NIH has a healthy budget and continues to fund the research, I do really believe that novel medications and improved treatment strategies are around the corner.\u201d",

National and state groups representing a cross-section of caregivers, families, community advocates, healthcare professionals and more came together to demand action as the death toll surpasses 200 people per day dying due to synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\n\n\"Today's opioid crisis demands we specifically address fentanyl-related overdoses,\" says Mary Bono, Chair and CEO of MAPDA. \"As a mother, former Congresswoman, and an advocate, I have witnessed the devastating impact of the opioid epidemic and have seen the destruction it has caused countless communities across the country. With International Overdose Awareness Day approaching, we are reminded of the urgent need to address this crisis and provide communities with all FDA-approved reversal agents.\"\n\nThe groups write, \"Opioid overdoses know no bounds and often impact the most vulnerable. The increased lethality of synthetic opioids exacerbates these dangers, and the cost of lives is stark.\"\n\nThe letter offers recommendations to address the issue head-on:\n\nImprove access to innovation by opening state standing orders to ensure access to all overdose reversal agents approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nPublish State Opioid Response grant distribution action plans to ensure transparency and further support communities.\n\nPrioritize data modernization initiatives that improve overdose surveillance data.\n\nOffer regular training and update protocols for law enforcement, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and other first responders.\n\nImplement or update overdose education and awareness communication campaign(s) to include synthetic opioid relevant messages.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the opioid crisis knows no boundaries and impacts communities from coast to coast. As more lives are lost, drug overdose death disparities are widening, disproportionately impacting communities of color,\" says Marvell Adams, CEO of Caregiver Action Network. \"We have the tools to combat overdoses; it's time every state optimizes access to them.\"\n\nNotably, the letter comes days before International Overdose Awareness Day is recognized on August 31, 2024. Advocates wrote to governors whose states are currently without access to all FDA-improved opioid reversal agents that target synthetic opioids like fentanyl, and require additional, comprehensive policy solutions.

        "text": "A lex Neville was one of those boys who was always in costume, wearing his obsessions on his sleeve. At three, he went around dressed as a mummy, earnestly explaining the embalming process to children in Aliso Viejo, a town in Orange County, California. At seven, he was SoCal\u2019s shortest Civil War junkie, dragging his father to local reenactments of the Battle of Gettysburg. It was at one of those events that he met his great hero: a tall, bearded schnook playing Abe Lincoln. \u201cAlex was speechless when he shook \u2018Abe\u2019s\u2019 hand,\u201d says his father, Aaron Neville. \u201cFor him, it was like meeting Beyonc\u00e9!\u201d\n\nBut for all his little-professor chi, Alex was a boy\u2019s boy through and through. He ran with his wolf pack of free-range kids from kindergarten on. They boogie-boarded riptides and stunt-jumped skate bowls, anything for a G-pass from gravity. It was hard being one of the brightest kids in class, though, when his brain kept overheating. \u201cWe knew two things about him early on,\u201d says his mom, Amy Neville, a heart-faced woman with the watchful zen of a longtime yoga instructor. \u201cOne, he was borderline genius \u2014 at least. Two, he had ADD. Or something.\u201d\n\nAlex couldn\u2019t sit still or manage his moods; the smallest things triggered eruptions. \u201cAs we found out from his therapist, he had a \u2018ring of fire\u2019 brain; it never switched off,\u201d says Amy. Alex lived at the whims of his central nervous system, and the first thing that tamed it was weed. \u201cHe smoked in seventh grade. For him, it was like, \u2018Where have you been?!\u2019\u201d\n\nHow does Amy know this? Because Alex told her everything that passed between his ears. He gave his mom the blow-by-blow on his middle school romances. When he broke his word and smoked weed again, he confessed that, too. And when weed wasn\u2019t enough, and he bought his first pills online, then got hooked on what he thought was Oxycontin, he went to his terrified parents and told all: A dealer I met on Snapchat. He taught me to use PayPal. I\u2019ve been using for the last seven days.\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nAmy Neville spent that night and the next day, too, trying to book her son a rehab bed. But this was 2020, three months into the pandemic; no one was going anywhere overnight. The following morning, he had a dentist\u2019s appointment. Neville opened his door and found him sprawled on his beanbag, his left hand tucked in his waistband. There was vomit on his shirt, and his lips were blue. Alex Neville \u2014 age 14, a freshly minted eighth-grade graduate \u2014 had been dead for at least six hours.\n\nSoon, Neville\u2019s house was aswarm with cops. One of them found a vial with seven blue pills in a box on Alex\u2019s nightstand. They field-swabbed the residue, then explained to Amy which poison had killed her child. Fentanyl from China, by way of someone\u2019s basement. Mixed by dealers in $30 blenders that leave chunks, or lethal \u201chot spots,\u201d in the pills.\n\nFor weeks thereafter, Neville stumbled through fog. She shut her yoga studio and sat alone with her sorrow, unable to pull truth from facts. How could a kid so loved and alive get addicted to a surgical anesthetic? Sheriff\u2019s deputies had no answers, and the DEA wouldn\u2019t comment. So Neville got off her couch and started digging.\n\nThe first clue came from a girl Alex knew. She hadn\u2019t met the dealer, but she\u2019d seen his online handle: He went by AJ Smokxy on Snapchat. Other friends in middle school copped from him, too; he\u2019d deliver the pills right to your door. The next penny dropped when a ping came in on Facebook. I know who killed your son, said the stranger. It\u2019s the same guy on Snapchat who killed my Hector.\n\nThe sender was a bereft mom named Valerie Bradley. Her son Hector OD\u2019d on July 7, 2020, two weeks after Alex passed. Bradley sent Neville screenshots of texts Smokxy had posted to Snapchat. The first was Smokxy ranting that he\u2019d only sold Alex weed, not pills. In a second text, he denied killing another kid two weeks before Alex died. That seemingly made three boys dead in four weeks. Neville sent those details off to Dave Mertus, the DEA agent working on Alex\u2019s case. She waited for his call, or for news of Smokxy\u2019s arrest. Nothing. Just the screaming in her head.\n\nMeanwhile, children went on dying. A school friend of Alex\u2019s, 15 and pretty, died seven miles away, in her bed; a fentanyl pill bought online. Three kids from the local high school were killed in 13 months. Cause of death: fake pills bought online. That fall, Neville went to a survivors\u2019 conference in Ohio, and says she met parent after parent of SoCal kids allegedly poisoned by Snapchat dealers. They\u2019d drowned in that first tall wave of overdose deaths: More than 950 kids killed in 2020, 70 percent of them felled by fentanyl and other synthetic drugs; 1,150 more died in the first six months of 2021, three-quarters of those deaths from fentanyl and synthetics.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, the number of teen deaths from fentanyl tripled \u2014 and the driver of that plague, per the cops and feds I talked to, was fake pills sold online. Phony opioids that looked like Oxycontins but were cut with fentanyl, not oxycodone; bogus Xanax but with fentanyl, not alprazolam, on board. Name any pharmaceutical with a foothold on campus \u2014 Adderall, Valium, Suboxone, what-have-you \u2014 and it was instantly available via social media and delivered to your door like Papa John\u2019s.\n\nThe folks compounding those pills weren\u2019t pharm-school grads. They were cartel adjuncts or lost-soul dropouts with a storage unit and a pill press. And whether their fentanyl came from Mexico or directly from China, they were everywhere and nowhere at once: invisible on the street but ubiquitous online; and many were hawking poison disguised as pharma drugs over Snapchat.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re a fake-pill dealer, where would you rather work?\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, no one seemed to be doing a damn thing about it. The DEA didn\u2019t launch its first PSA alert until the fall of 2021, and local cops walked away, or made half-hearted searches of a deceased kid\u2019s phone for actionable links to the dealer. Those links were long gone, though, scrubbed minutes or hours after the last exchange between seller and buyer. That, Neville learned, was why the dealers had moved to Snapchat: It was effectively a safe space for them. All forensics vanished within 24 hours, wiped clean by the delete function of the app. That wasn\u2019t a bug but a feature of Snap, the code choice that sent its fortunes soaring and marked it out from its social media rivals. On TikTok and Instagram, your DMs and photos largely lived till you deleted them, one by one. On Snap, it was the reverse: Everything turned to smoke unless you manually saved it to your account.\n\nThis was manna for kids, who could text (or sext) each other without fear of their parents\u2019 prying eyes. But that disappearing ink was a godsend for dealers too \u2014 a chance to sell narcotics and leave no breadcrumbs for the cops and feds to follow. This made all the difference to fake-pill pushers, whose product was as lethal as it was deceptive. Two milligrams of fentanyl \u2014 think 10 grains of salt \u2014 would asphyxiate a teen in his bed. Why fentanyl? Because it\u2019s so plentiful and potent that you can produce a fake Oxy for less than five cents a pill \u2014 and sell that pill to kids for $30. Dealers, as a rule, don\u2019t try to kill their clients, but with fentanyl, it\u2019s the cost of doing business. No home cook can process a batch of \u201cXanax\u201d without peppering chunks of fentanyl in the mix. Those chunks get pressed into the random pill \u2014 or half-pill, as sometimes happens. I know of one kid who split a \u201cPercocet\u201d with his girlfriend, then suffocated while she slept soundly. Per the latest report from the DEA, roughly 70 percent of the fake pills seized by agents contain fatal doses of fenty. For every pill they flag, though, many more get through and wind up for sale online.\n\nTo be sure, dealers hawk their poisons on all the social apps, but, law-enforcement sources say, they commonly sealed the deal on their Snapchat account because of its clandestine features. The app largely shields them from undercover cops posing as teenage buyers and affords them further safeguards like the Snap Map feature that shows them, in real time, where a kid is waiting. There\u2019s also an in-app alert that warns the dealer if a kid has tried to screenshot their chats. \u201cIf you\u2019re a fake-pill dealer, where would you rather work? On a platform where they destroy all evidence of your crimes, or on TikTok, where they keep and archive that evidence in case law enforcement calls?\u201d says Bill Bodner, the recently retired boss of the Los Angeles field office of the Drug Enforcement Admin\u00adistration. \u201cI spent five years trying to get something out of Snapchat. Not once did they come across with something useful.\u201d\n\nMoreover, says Bodner and a dozen sources in law enforcement who talked to me for this story, Snapchat seemed to slow-walk police investigations after fake pills killed young buyers. Court orders and subpoenas sat for weeks and months with Snap\u2019s law-enforcement team. What data Snap disclosed, after long delays, proved useless, insufficient, or both, according to law enforcement. Such was the feds\u2019 frustration with Snap that a top official at the Department of Justice called me last summer with an urgent plea. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from too many parents whose kids were poisoned \u2014 and none of those kids knew they\u2019d bought fake pills.\u201d\n\nOver eight months reporting the facts of this story, a week or so working on a documentary with grieving parents that was just as quickly shelved, and five months of pressing Snapchat officials for frank answers to pointed questions, I\u2019ve come up against two mutually exclusive accounts. There\u2019s the heartsick version told by parents, cops, and lawyers about anxious kids without a lick of street savvy who bought pills from a stranger on Snapchat and died 20 feet away from their mother\u2019s bedroom. And then there\u2019s the version told by Snapchat: That it has strenuously enforced a zero-tolerance policy regarding drug dealers and their poisons; that since 2014 its trust and safety teams have worked tirelessly to protect their users; and that since fake-pill dealers surged to the socials at the start of the pandemic, Snap has done everything in its mortal power to partner with law enforcement. Bluntly put, there\u2019s no common ground occupied by these parties. What follows are the facts as I found them. To begin, here\u2019s Snap on the feds\u2019 contention that the platform has been a hub for fake-pill dealers.\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken by this terrible epidemic and \u2026 are deeply committed to the fight against fentanyl. We\u2019ve invested in advance technology to detect and remove drug-related contents, worked extensively with law enforcement to bring dealers to justice, and continue to evolve our service to keep our community safe. Criminals have no place on Snapchat,\u201d said Jacqueline Beauchere, Snap\u2019s head of global platform safety.\n\nBut when pushed for specifics \u2014 which cops or federal officers had Snapchat \u201cwork[ed] extensively with,\u201d which drug dealers had they helped bring to justice? \u2014 Snap said, \u201cThe law requires us to respond to subpoenas and search warrants according to a detailed process, which we acknowledge can be frustrating for law enforcement and our team. If we don\u2019t follow the process, the evidence we provide could become inadmissible, and that\u2019s not an outcome any of us want.\u201d\n\nI spent five years trying to get something out of Snapchat,\u201d says Bill Bodner, former head of the Los Angeles division of the DEA. \u201cNot once did they bring something useful.\n\n\u2014\n\nNow, up against a firm with tens of billions, most parents would have let the matter lie, going back to tend their shattered families. Not Neville: She mustered an army of grieving parents through a series of Zooms and meetups. She flew around the country, pumping online watchdogs for everything they knew about Snapchat. She sat with U.S. senators and Department of Justice staffers, asking why a company was allowed to shield the dealers who were hurting or killing children. There\u2019s not much we can do, said the Beltway folks. \u201cSnap\u2019s protected by a law from 1996 \u2014 and no one\u2019s been able to touch them,\u201d she paraphrases. Section 230c, a 26-word addendum to the Communications Decency Act, gave social media companies broad-strokes immunity from crimes committed by their users. Time and again, they\u2019d been sued by the victims of revenge porn, extortion, and cyberstalking. Time and again, those claims were tossed by judges citing Section 230. No industry in America had such far-going protections \u2014 despite stacks of reports that Snapchat, , et al. were enabling bad actors to commit harms against young users.\n\nBut with all this massed against her, Neville pressed ahead. \u201cSomeone had to hold those people accountable,\u201d she says of Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, the former wonder boys from Stanford who founded what would become Snapchat off-campus in the summer of 2011. \u201cIf they\u2019d just done anything to show me they were human, I\u2019d have backed away.\u201d Instead, in 2021, they tapped a stand-in to Zoom with Neville and a handful of other parents who\u2019d lost children. Neville says that senior executive badly misread the room. Per Neville and other parents on the call, the executive minimized its role in the overdose crisis, saying Snap \u2014 worth more than $50 billion at the time \u2014 was just a small company and only now learning about this problem. Neville sat there, speechless, feeling her fury cook. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt was, \u2018We don\u2019t even see you tiny ants.\u2019\u201d\n\n(Snap\u2019s response, via Beauchere: \u201cWe are grateful for the opportunity to listen to families who have shared their stories and offered feedback on how we can help keep our community safe. We have met with Mrs. Neville on two occasions in addition to communicating on the phone and via email, and we would never attempt to minimize her important story.\u201d)\n\nIn the spring of 2021, Neville found a law firm, C.A. Goldberg, to take her case and those of six other families. They\u2019ve since added a second firm and dozens more families, and their long-shot civil case beat the odds. Around six months ago, a California judge gave Neville and her peers the ruling they\u2019d prayed for: access to Snap\u2019s internal data. That ruling has been briefly stayed, pending Snap\u2019s appeal. But if upheld, Neville\u2019s lawyers will comb through Snap\u2019s files, establishing what, and when, its leaders knew regarding drug dealers and dead kids. Things could get ugly fast for Messrs. Spiegel and Murphy. Whatever the outcome, this much is certain: They messed with the wrong mother and found out.\n\n\u2018The best way to sext\u2019\n\nSometime in the spring of his junior year at Stanford, an English major named Reggie Brown had a lucrative revelation. Brown, per several reports, was sending phone pics of himself to a girl he knew \u2014 and wished he could make them vanish once she got them. He bounded down the hall to share his epiphany with his Kappa Sigma frat bro, Evan Spiegel. \u201cWe should make an [app] that sends deleting-picture messages,\u201d said Brown. Spiegel, a 20-year-old raised Hollywood-posh \u2014 his parents\u2019 divorce suit and an L.A. Weekly feature reveal he attended the same prep school as Judd Apatow\u2019s kids; threw Gatsby-size parties at his father\u2019s mansion; and drove both a new Escalade and a Beamer in high school \u2014 knew a lottery winner when he heard one. \u201cThat\u2019s a million-dollar idea!\u201d he told Brown. The two friends quickly found a third, Bobby Murphy, to write the code for their creation. They repaired to L.A. when the school year ended, moving in with Spiegel\u2019s father, a securities lawyer.\n\nThere, they divvied up the jobs and titles. Spiegel, the CEO, designed the app\u2019s features. Murphy, the tech chief, programmed the site, and Brown, the chief marketing officer, wrote up everything else, from press releases to terms-of-service language. The purpose of the app seemed plain enough: Their press draft cited campus \u201cbetches\u201d and the perils of \u201cincriminating photos.\u201d \u201c[Without Snapchat], a betch would be at the mercy of her captor if anyone got hold of her phone.\u201d Spiegel pitched his product to a female blogger, \u00adwriting, \u201cGurl, I just built an app with two \u2026 certified bros that I think you\u2019ll really like.\u201d \u201cAah,\u201d she replied, after feeling it out. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, the best way to sext?\u201d Spiegel responded: \u201cLucky guess.\u201d\n\nSpiegel \u2014 the youngest billionaire on the Forbes World\u2019s Youngest Billionaires List four years after Snap\u2019s launch \u2014 has since walked back the smuttiness of its birth. \u201cI just don\u2019t know people who [sext on Snap]. It doesn\u2019t seem that fun when you can have real sex,\u201d he told TechCrunch back in 2012. One of Snap\u2019s spokespeople met me for breakfast and tried to dissuade me of any vulgar misconceptions. \u201cWhen Evan and Bobby [Murphy] created Snap, they and their friends felt they had to perform to get noticed [on social media],\u201d she tells me. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Why can\u2019t we have a place that\u2019s oriented around talking to friends the way you do in real life?\u2019 Our messaging is ephemeral because people are more comfortable sharing life\u2019s moments \u2026 when they\u2019re not recorded permanently \u2026 for the world to see.\u201d\n\nIn response, I raise Spiegel\u2019s emails, written to his frat brothers shortly before he founded Snapchat. To be sure, he was 19 or 20 when he sent them, but their baked-in misogyny digs deep:\n\nHope at least six girl [sic] sucked your dicks last night \u2026 Fuckbitchesgetleid.\n\nHave some girl put your large kappa sigma dick down her throat \u2026 can\u2019t wait to see everyone on the blackout express.\n\nI wonder if my TA has ever been peed on. She\u2019s pretty hot for a Tri-Delt.\n\n\u2014Evan Spiegel\n\nThe spokesperson referred me to Spiegel\u2019s apology after the emails were leaked in 2014. \u201cI\u2019m obviously mortified and embarrassed that my idiotic emails during my fraternity days were made public\u2026They in no way reflect who I am today or my views toward women.\u201d\n\nThose emails, dumped to Valleywag, an erstwhile tech blog, surfaced a year after Spiegel and Murphy were sued by Snap\u2019s co-founder, Reggie Brown. There\u2019d been an ugly rupture in the summer of 2011: Brown stormed off after overhearing his partners plot to oust him. He soon filed a lawsuit and brought receipts, including a text from Spiegel that seemed conclusive: \u201cI want to make sure you feel like you are given credit for the idea of disappearing messages.\u201d\n\nThrough their lawyers, Spiegel and Murphy rebuffed Brown\u2019s claims. So the suit slogged ahead, creating a public record of Snap\u2019s contentious founding. When paired with a second batch of court filings \u2014 the transcripts of his parents\u2019 lavish divorce \u2014 a sense of Spiegel emerges as a shark-toothed chancer in a rush to build an empire by 25. As he\u2019d later tell young aspirants at Stanford, \u201cIt\u2019s not about working harder. It\u2019s about working the system.\u201d\n\nMuch of what we know of Spiegel stems from those two lawsuits \u2014 including the cost of settling with Brown. As reported by Snap to the Securities and Exchange Commission when the company went public in 2017, Spiegel and Murphy paid Brown around $158 million to renounce his equity bid. It was the largest sum paid to a tech-bro founder since the reported $65 million that Facebook paid the Winklevoss twins to fuck off. Between the dump of his college emails and the check he sent to Brown, Spiegel got a crash course in crisis management before he turned 25.\n\nWhat\u2019s past dispute, though, is his business savvy: Spiegel is a genius at making markets. In the fall of 2011 \u2014 per a Forbes report \u2014 Spiegel scanned the metrics on Snapchat usage and saw it peaked between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. His core customers, he surmised, were schoolkids, not frat boys sending ghost pics of bongs and boners. Rather than course-correct, he seemed to steer straight for it, developing features that ensorcelled a generation: Filters that morphed kids into kittens and ponies, and allowed them to \u201cswap\u201d faces with their friends. Wallpapers that placed them in Paris and Vegas, plus a sweet-shop selection of hearts and starbursts to glow up their giddy shots. Kids were using their phones to make art, or at least menagerie, of selfies. They could play with each other, online and in life: Snap Map, launched in 2017, showed them where their friends were skating, or where the party was on Friday night.\n\nBest of all, kids could climb the ladder on Snap, posting content that earned them clout with other teens. Sending lots of Snaps boosted a kid\u2019s Snap Score. That fast became a badge of social capital; the higher your Snap Score, the more juice you had with your Snap friends, real and virtual. It was also a strong incentive to accept friend requests from people you\u2019d never met. Kids got Quick Add suggestions from Snap that were culled from their contacts. But a second batch were users with no obvious linkage \u2014 and some of those strangers harbored bad intentions, say Neville\u2019s lawyers in courtroom affidavits.\n\n\u201cDuring the period of our lawsuit \u2014 2019 to the present \u2014 Snap was pushing Quick Add strangers by the hundreds to young kids,\u201d says Laura Marquez-Garrett, a senior attorney at the Social Media Victims Law Center (SMVLC), the law firm suing on behalf of Neville and 63 other families. \u201cWe tested it ourselves, posing as 16-year-olds on three new burner phones. On two of them, we got a Quick Add screen with hundreds of \u2018friends\u2019 we didn\u2019t know.\u201d Men with pill or dick emojis in their handles, and women with dollar signs, says Marquez-Garrett. \u201cWe tried to steer away, but a screen popped up that said \u2018Interacting with friends is what Snapchat\u2019s all about. Are you sure you want to skip this step?\u2019\u201d Their firm filmed step-by-step footage of those sign-ups and submitted the\n\nreels to court.\n\nOne of Snap\u2019s motives for pushing Quick Add suggestions was to maximize the time kids spent on Snap, claims Marquez-Garrett. But the kids who friended a dealer through Quick Add suggestions were exposed to many others \u2014 and vice versa, per Marquez-Garrett. \u201cOnce a dealer gets connected to a kid, it opens all that kid\u2019s contacts to him, too.\u201d\n\nSnap\u2019s response? \u201cSnapchat was built to help people communicate with their close friends and family. Our goal is to make it as hard as possible for a bad actor to find and contact a teen \u2026 and we continue to roll out new protections to mitigate unwanted contact and prevent the discovery of potentially harmful content.\u201d\n\nIn reporting this piece, I talked to a dozen or so kids about their experience with Snap. The older ones acknowledged getting Quick Adds with strangers, but said that happened on other apps, too. And yes, they knew Snap was fraught with drug content, but many including Jackson, a college freshman in California, \u201conly fucked with the people selling weed there.\u201d Mostly, they spoke about how central Snap was as a touch point to their friends. \u201cYou literally can\u2019t function without it,\u201d says Katherine, a college-age kid in Massachusetts. \u201cIt\u2019s how we talk to each other. You\u2019d be totally nowhere without it.\u201d\n\nYounger users lapped up its fun-house features and spent hours on it horsing around. \u201cI like it \u2019cause the lenses give you big, giant eyebrows, and make your jaw two feet long,\u201d says Sophie. Her twin, Brooklyn, had a crush on Snap\u2019s AI, dressing his avatar in Jordans and a backward baseball cap. \u201cThen he sent me a text saying, \u2018I\u2019m uncomfortable being called \u2018boyfriend,\u2019\u201d Brooklyn says. That didn\u2019t hurt my feelings, though. He\u2019s only a machine.\u201d\n\nIt bears saying that Sophie and Brooklyn are 12 years old and opened their Snap accounts when they were nine. Snap forbids that; the minimum age for sign-up is 13. This problem is not specific to Snap: None of the socials require proof of age or demand parental consent. But no other firm has chased the youth demo with the single-mindedness of Snap. By the start of the pandemic, per Tech Policy Press, 92 percent of Snap\u2019s user base was between the ages of 12 and 17. Riding that demographic, Snap aimed for the stars and achieved escape velocity fast. It went from 20,000 users in those first few months to more than 140 million in five years. (Mark Zuckerberg offered Spiegel $3 billion to take Snap off his hands in 2013. Spiegel turned him down.) Per Reuters, last year, Snap earned $4.6 billion; Spiegel\u2019s net worth was $3.6 billion at press time, according to Forbes.\n\nBut by the summer of 2021, Snap was battered by bad PR. Fake-pill poisonings traced to Snapchat dealers made the local and national news. Bereaved parents sobbed on the Today show and Dr. Phil, singling out Snapchat for their loss. Families with signs and bullhorns marched on Snap\u2019s office in Santa Monica, calling for Spiegel\u2019s arrest. Once the online playground for tweens and teens, Snap was now the Big Tech face of the fake-pill plague. Its executives were hauled in front of Congress to explain why young users were dying. Multiple laws were pushed by a Senate subcommittee to hold Snap and its rivals accountable for harming kids. (Mired in political quicksand, none of those bills have come to votes yet.) And several other lawsuits besides Neville\u2019s trundled toward court, seeking damages in the untold billions from Snap and the other social media giants for \u201cfueling the nationwide youth mental health crisis,\u201d per New York City\u2019s Mayor Eric Adams.\n\nCovid drove dealers online, because that\u2019s where the kids were. And Snap was the top spot. \u2014Bill Bodner, former head of the DEA in Los Angeles\n\nTo be fair, other platforms hosted millions of kids, too, and were beset by dealers and their pills. And consider the sheer scale of Snap\u2019s safety challenge: Each day, 5 billion posts are exchanged by its users, or more than 2 million a minute. But crimes done on TikTok left durable tracks for law enforcement to follow. On Snap, the trail was faint and short-lived. According to multiple law-enforcement sources, between 2019 and late 2022 \u2014 the years of inquiry in this story \u2014 that vanishing ink was a stone wall for cops, and a boon to Snap\u2019s criminal users. Dealers plastered menus of their pills and prices on their public-\u00adfacing Stories page. They posted up in places where kids hung out and pinned menus to their Snap Map tabs. Up popped the profiles of Snap users nearby \u2014 and an easy way to tell kids from cops.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is look at their Snap Score: No cop could build a Score in the six figures,\u201d says Bodner, the former DEA chief. Bodner was there at the birth of the fake-pill epidemic. His team bagged its first major supplier in 2016, and a second one two years later. He and his agents have been to dozens of houses where children died in their beds, racing the clock to crack the victim\u2019s phone before his Snap texts disappeared. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a very short window, unless the kid and dealer switched to [standard] texts to finish the buy,\u201d Bodner says.\n\nIn 2017, multiple mainstream outlets sounded the alarm about Snapchat. An undercover reporter for the BBC met dealers making thousands of pounds a day selling drugs to schoolkids on socials. \u201cI fear it is going to take something very tragic \u2026 before Instagram and Snapchat wake up,\u201d said the reporter, Stacey Dooley. Corroborating accounts in The Guardian, The Mirror, and on Fox delivered the hard news to Snap\u2019s doorstep. Snap\u2019s response? Rote statements about its \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d and its \u201cdedicated Trust and Safety Team.\u201d The press kept ringing Snap\u2019s bell and found no one home.\n\nPressed about those statements, Snap says: \u201cSnapchat has always had policies that prohibit using our service to try to sell illicit drugs. During the early days of the pandemic, society as a whole \u2026 was learning about the more recent and growing epidemic of dealers selling counterfeit pills. We were working vigorously, around the clock, to improve our tools and systems for fighting it.\u201d\n\nStill, say my sources at the DEA, Snapchat teemed with dealers, large and small. \u201cWe saw fake pills on socials before the pandemic, but Covid drove all the dealers online, because that\u2019s where the kids were,\u201d says Bodner. \u201cSnap was, by far, the top spot for dealers \u2014 and once they saw how easy it was, they just never left.\u201d\n\nPharma-Master and Oxygod\n\nYears from now, when researchers write the history of the fake-pill wave, they\u2019ll do well to park themselves in Salt Lake City and parse the case notes of Detective Dennis Power. A narcotics cop of 20 years\u2019 distinction, Power was on loan to a DEA task force in Utah when he caught a lead in 2015: A series of small parcels from a distributor in Shanghai were being shipped to more than 20 addresses in town. One of the parcels ripped when it passed through U.S. customs; agents opened it and found 100 grams of fentanyl. They flagged the distributor and alerted the Utah task force; Power ran the names of the local recipients. None of them had rap sheets or hung out together. Their only connection was a man named Aaron Shamo; he either picked the parcels up or they brought them to his house, a nondescript one-family in town.\n\nThen Power, who\u2019d worked the case for the best part of six months, got the tip of a lifetime. His source was a guy he\u2019d busted who was hoping to cut a deal. \u201cHe says, \u2018I don\u2019t just get packages and give them to Shamo. I drive out to the suburbs and pick up a bunch of boxes [from a house], then drop \u2019em in a different P.O. Box each day.\u2019\u201d\n\nPower alerted his boss; agents scrambled to tail the runners. One of them followed Shamo out of town, to a posh suburb called South Jordan City. He saw Shamo pull a duffel bag from his trunk and plunk it into the trunk of a second car. Shamo drove off, but another agent hung behind, staying on the car with the bag. Not long after, a woman came out of a house and dragged the heavy duffel up her front steps. That night, Power\u2019s informant got a text: The boxes are ready for pickup on the porch.\n\nThe snitch collected the boxes and brought all 79 of them to the station. \u201cWe open them up, and every fucking jaw drops: There were a half-million pills on that lunch table,\u201d says Power. Fake Xanax and Oxycontins, most derived from fentanyl but a dead-perfect match for the drugs they purported to be. That head-smacking haul \u2014 worth $15 million on the street \u2014 represented two days of work by one man. Later, when agents hit Shamo\u2019s house, they found him in his basement. Two pill presses the size of fridges were ka-chunking out tabs marked \u201cM 30\u201d \u2014 the stamp you\u2019d see on an Oxycontin 30.\n\nPower sizzled with shock. Here, in the middle of white-boy nowhere, he\u2019d stumbled onto a merchant of mass extinction: a handsome former Mormon who\u2019d dropped out of college, quit his dead-end job at eBay, and become the dark-web kingpin called Pharma-Master. In the months to follow, they\u2019d trace those fenta-\u00adpills of Shamo\u2019s to dozens of deaths around the country.\n\nThe story of Aaron Shamo marks an inflection point in America\u2019s War on Drugs. For the first 50 years, the enemy was external, or so we were told by the authorities. Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia: The cartels were the cause of all our woe \u2014 and never mind that they didn\u2019t put a gun to our heads and make us the world\u2019s thirstiest users of narcotics. Then, quietly, with no great effort or plan, America\u2019s millennials got in the game. In the middle of the last decade, kids with factory jobs and limited prospects found their way to the dark side: specifically, to a site called AlphaBay. Launched in 2014 by a Canadian coder named Alexandre Cazes, AlphaBay wasted not a single second becoming the foremost dark-net market for criminal commerce.\n\n\u201cSex traffic, murder for hire, exotic animals, drugs: You name it, it was for sale there,\u201d says Ray Donovan, the recently retired chief of the Special Operations for the DEA worldwide. \u201cKids in their teens would log onto Alpha, go to the chat rooms for fentanyl dealers, and order up a key of pure from Wuhan.\u201d Days later, they\u2019d find a brown box sitting on their doorstep \u2014 brought by that great new drug mule, the U.S. Postal Service. Here was Shamo\u2019s ticket, and he cashed it hard, becoming one of the biggest vendors on AlphaBay in a hurry. When the feds swept in, garbed in Tyvek suits, they found more than a million dollars, cash, in Shamo\u2019s sock drawer, and many millions more in his Bitcoin wallet.\n\nShamo was convicted of a kingpin charge and sentenced to serve life in federal prison. Cazes, the AlphaBay founder, was hunted down and captured on a quiet block in Bangkok by the Royal Thai Police in 2017. Right before he was extradited to the U.S. for arraignment, Cazes was found dead in his jail cell. By then, though, Shamo was a dark-net totem, the model for aspiring dons in every suburb. One squad tells me they staged two career busts in the span of 25 months. \u201cStacy\u201d and her team (they\u2019re still active agents, so they can\u2019t be named in this piece) nailed the biggest dealer in SoCal in 2016. \u201cInitially, we thought he was just making Molly,\u201d says Stacy. \u201cThen we raided his lab and found five industrial presses going at once.\u201d\n\nTheir next arrest made the bigger splash, however \u2014 if only for the arrestee\u2019s clout on socials. In a past life, Wyatt Pasek could have been a boy-band star: He was a leaner, sulkier version of Nick Carter. But to fund his studio sessions, he sold fentanyl, says Stacy. He was at it \u201cthree years before we nailed him.\u201d\n\nBy then, he was known by his new persona: the Lambo-driving don called Oxygod. There he was on TikTok, kicking back in a bathtub overflowing with hundred-dollar bills. There he was again, fanning bricks of cash on the hood of his tricked-out rides. Pasek got nearly 18 years of fed time, or roughly as long as he\u2019d been alive. It was when he went to prison, though, that Pasek lived out his dream: to influence a generation of kids. The dark web \u201cwent crazy when they read our [indictment] affidavit and saw all the mistakes that Pasek made,\u201d says Stacy. \u201cThey posted tips on Reddit that they gleaned from his screwups \u2014 and that definitely inspired [a second wave of] kids to get into the business of [online] drugs.\u201d Except that those kids didn\u2019t skulk around on AlphaBay. Instead, they hawked their goods on sunny, spangled Snapchat.\n\nThere, according to the DEA, they had company \u2014 and competition. The cartels, who\u2019d been trucking over fentanyl bricks, \u201csaw what these kids were earning on socials and got heavy into the pill game, too,\u201d says Donovan, the former chief of Special Operations at the DEA. \u201cA key of pure fenty was $3,000 wholesale.\u201d But that same key made as many as 500,000 pills that sold for $30 apiece. \u201cNext thing we know, the cartels are only sending pills and marketing them over the apps. Open-source socials became the sales hub for fenty \u2014 and Snapchat was, by far, the most prolific.\u201d\n\n\u2018A safe haven to sell drugs\u2019\n\nIn his last days, Alex Neville did what most teens were doing during those mass-confinement months of early Covid: He tagged in with his locked-down tribe on Snapchat. For his generation, Snap was the grapevine; every thought or face-plant was posted there. Where\u2019s the hang tonight? Who\u2019s hungry for Chipotle? Anyone know that new girl in the Dunks? To reassure his mother, Alex showed her his phone whenever she asked to see it. \u201cI\u2019d go through his socials looking for sex stuff and bullies,\u201d says Neville. \u201cYou know: the threats we were warned about online.\u201d\n\nLike each parent in this story, she\u2019d never heard of fake pills till one of them killed her son. And the notion that Snapchat might be a hub for bad actors? It never once crossed her mind. \u201cFirst off, I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of [Snap],\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like it was made to be inscrutable to adults.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not wrong, says Marquez-Garrett. If you downloaded the app and self-identified as a grownup, you\u2019d get a whole lot of nothing in your feed. Some innocuous friend suggestions; pushy requests to link your Contacts; and a spinning wheel of crass but harmless fluff. But log in as a teen and you\u2019d find a vastly different bag. \u201cBased on our interviews with a hundred-plus kids, boys were getting menus for serious drugs within weeks of signing up. If you were a girl, you were getting dick pics from strangers \u2014 even if you posted no content of your own,\u201d says Marquez-Garrett.\n\nSnap\u2019s response: \u201cQuick Add makes friend suggestions based on a mutual connection. Quick Add does not recommend users based on shared interests or because users may be near a similar location like a school or a park. Approximately 90 percent of friend requests received by teens on Snapchat are from someone with at least one mutual friend in common. And even for the remaining percent, the Snapchat user would need to affirmatively accept the friend request before someone can communicate with them.\u201d\n\nMarquez-Garrett is a former partner at a prestige practice who left their corner office to join the Social Media Victims Law Center in Seattle. It\u2019s a newish firm of five attorneys who banded together for one goal: to hold Snapchat and its rivals \u2014 Meta, TikTok, and Google (owner of YouTube) \u2014 accountable for the harms they\u2019ve done to children. Three years ago, that mission was a moon shot: to come up against four platforms that were protected by settled law and whose collective worth was in the trillions. Other lawyers thought \u201cthis was righteous but Sisyphean,\u201d says Matthew Bergman, the firm\u2019s founder. \u201cEveryone suing these companies lost, and most didn\u2019t get past dismissal motions.\u201d\n\nBut Bergman\u2019s the sort of lawyer who strikes fear in fat cats\u2019 hearts. For more than 20 years, he beat asbestos makers in court, sending manufacturers into bankruptcy after they paid out billions of dollars to their victims. \u201cIn what other industry can you harm your young users and keep doing business like it never happened?\u201d he asks. \u201cThey\u2019ve used the same legal fig leaf\u201d \u2014 Section 230 \u2014 \u201cas a license to damage children.\u201d\n\nSection 230 treated web firms of the Netscape era as next-gen telecom companies. It viewed their platforms as services, not products, a crucial distinction for liability. \u201cIf you hired me over the phone to kill your wife,\u201d says Bodner, \u201cSprint couldn\u2019t be charged as an accomplice.\u201d But what lawmaker of the 1990s could have foreseen a time when 12-year-olds had the internet in their pocket?\n\n\u201cThe first claim we filed [against Snapchat, Meta, and TikTok] was on behalf of Selena, a young girl who killed herself on livestream,\u201d says Bergman. \u201cShe was offered money by older men to masturbate on camera \u2014 starting at the age of 10.\u201d Lonely and addicted to her social media feeds, Selena plunged into a deep despond and filmed her death-by-overdose on Snap. She was 11 years old.\n\nBergman now represents more than a thousand families who say their kids were exploited on social media. Most of his cases share a baseline claim: that social media firms have crafted their platforms\u2019 features to addict young brains for profit.\n\nBergman\u2019s contention is that fentanyl killed these children after Snap connected them to dealers. That\u2019s why he broke out poisoning deaths, presented them as a separate group of civil claims \u2014 and named only Snapchat as the offender. In the spring of 2023, he filed 64 claims against Snap in an L.A. courthouse, seeking unspecified damages on behalf of Alex Neville and dozens of other children who died. He has dozens more families waiting in line, queueing for their chance to hold Snapchat accountable in the deaths of their sons and daughters.\n\n\u201cOur position is that Snap\u2019s features gave dealers a safe haven to sell kids lethal drugs,\u201d says Bergman. \u201cThe geo-locator feature; the My Eyes Only feature, which let them store and hide kids\u2019 info; and Snap\u2019s back-end deletion of dealers\u2019 texts and menus. Those features are unique to Snap.\u201d Additionally, he\u2019s suing Snap for negligence, alleging that Spiegel and his colleagues knew for years that kids were meeting dealers on Snap \u2014 and that the company did little to fix the problem.\n\nWe won\u2019t be bought out. All I care about is to see what Snap knew and when they knew it. \u2014Alex\u2019s mom, Amy Neville\n\nSnap disputes those charges: \u201cWe have been working for years to remove dealers from our platform. We proactively detect and remove drug-related content. Our Trust and Safety team has grown more than 150 percent since 2020, and our Law Enforcement Operations team has grown about 80 percent.\u201d Snap also sent me links to the company\u2019s transparency reports: twice-a-year breakouts of \u201cviolative content\u201d that Snap flagged and/or removed. In 2023, Snap reported that it \u201cremoved more than 2.2 million pieces of drug-related content, and disabled and blocked devices associated with 705,000 related accounts.\u201d\n\nBut since Snap is encrypted from end to end, I asked their reps to ratify those stats. They sent me to Tim Mackey, a renowned data scientist whose company, S-3, scours the internet for dealers. Snap retained him in 2022, but, he says, it never brought him behind the curtain to scan its data for drugs. Instead, they hired him to scrape other platforms and \u201creport those users back to Snap.\u201d What Snap does with that information \u201cisn\u2019t reported to us, though we\u2019re told they take down accounts,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut that\u2019s probably a small percentage of Snapchat dealers \u2014 and there\u2019s no way of knowing even that much.\u201d\n\nHe did say he\u2019d seen \u201ca reduction of dealers\u201d flashing Snap handles on other sites, and praised Snap for staffing up its security team, saying its ratio of monitors was now higher than the industry average. But whether those fixes have stemmed the flow of drugs is another matter entirely. \u201cI\u2019m pessimistic,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s still an upsurge of dealing on platforms where you\u2019d least expect it.\u201d Asked what it would take to improve kids\u2019 safety on socials, Mackey didn\u2019t pause before he spoke. \u201cThe criminal indictment of a tech firm,\u201d he said, \u201csuch as the investigation against Meta, to communicate the seriousness of the issue and ensure platforms are accountable to users and their families.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hell to make these cases\u2019\n\nAs a rule, poisoning cases are uphill battles: The evidence is ephemeral, then disappears. \u201cNinety-five percent of the cases go unsolved,\u201d says Bodner, whose office invested a year, and 500-plus man-hours, in the Alex Neville case. Dave Mertus, one of Bodner\u2019s most reliable agents, ran into the usual headwinds. It took his experts months to open Alex\u2019s iPhone, by which time any texts between Alex and the dealer had long since turned to smoke. Sit-downs with his school friends produced no leads, and subpoenas to FedEx and the U.S. Post Office showed no parcels received from suspected dealers. The only hard data was the coroner\u2019s report. That fake Oxy Alex swallowed contained enough fentanyl to kill all four members of his household.\n\nMertus, who\u2019s retired now, declined to comment, but provided his case notes through a source. He ID\u2019d AJ Smokxy as a 21-year-old male with gang ties to MS-13. Shortly thereafter, Smokxy was arrested by Orange County deputies. A search of his car and house yielded around 60 fake pills. But those deputies didn\u2019t know that Smokxy was linked to Snapchat deaths \u2014 and besides, this was California, post-Prop 47; that ballot initiative, passed in 2014, slashed most drug offenses to misdemeanors. And so Smokxy was kicked loose on little or no bail, then pinched again three months later. This time, he spent three days in lockup before they freed him on time served. In all, he was nailed seven times in three years. His longest stint in jail was eight months.\n\nBut Mertus had his phone now and got a warrant to search it while he waited for Smokxy\u2019s data from Snapchat. Here, according to the DEA, was where many of these cases died: waiting for data from Snap. Mertus subpoenaed Snap in March 2021. A month later, Snap rejected that motion for being \u201cambiguous;\u201d it sought data on four Smokxy accounts, not just one. Weeks went by before Snap answered a second subpoena, sending Mertus useless information. \u201cNo phone number, no email, no log-in, or log-out dates \u2014 just some gibberish about an account holder named \u2018Ronald,\u2019\u201d says Bodner.\n\nSnap\u2019s rejoinder: \u201cWe cannot discuss specific law-enforcement requests when they are covered by nondisclosure orders. But when law enforcement submits a subpoena we can respond by providing basic subscriber information and IP address logs.\u201d Moreover, Snap claims that it has begun inviting feedback from law enforcement, with \u201cmore than 93 percent of respondents reporting they had a \u2018good\u2019 experience with the company. When law enforcement provides a search warrant we can respond with content data preserved or available in the account if the warrant contains a valid request for it.\u201d\n\nPer Bodner, though, a subpoena was the correct court order in this case; the DEA wasn\u2019t looking for content from Snap, just contact information. Mertus knew who Smokxy was \u2014 his name certainly wasn\u2019t Ronald \u2014 he just didn\u2019t have enough to nail him. \u201cThe prosecutors here refuse to indict unless it\u2019s trafficking weight \u2014 at least 4,000 pills for fentanyl,\u201d says Bodner. \u201cSo these dealers get out a half-dozen times, even if they\u2019re dead to rights.\u201d\n\nBodner, who took retirement last fall, had more luck than most in making cases. His office won 20 convictions in five years against fenta-pill dealers in SoCal. Rather than truck with local DAs, he ordered his agents to build federal cases and bring them to U.S. Attorneys. \u201cThere\u2019s a statute we can use [in federal court] if we can prove that that dealer sold that pill,\u201d he says. It\u2019s called \u201cdeath-\u00adresulting, or great bodily harm,\u201d and carries 20 years of fed time upon conviction. Still, it\u2019s hell to make those cases, per Bodner. \u201cIn all my years of doing this, we got nothing back from Snap, so we had to get lucky with the [victim\u2019s] phone.\u201d They needed to open it within hours, before those texts disappeared, or hope that child and dealer spoke by other means \u2014 a phone call, or non-Snap texts.\n\nMeanwhile, Amy Neville sat and seethed as Alex\u2019s case turned cold. But given her gifts as a connector, it was just a matter of time before she met a mom with whom she shared a poisoner. Perla Mendoza, an educator and makeup artist, lost her son three months after Alex died. Daniel \u201cElijah\u201d Figueroa, 20, was a soulful church kid on the prongs of a spiritual crisis. He loved Jesus and he loved Juice WRLD, generally in that order. He filled notebook after notebook with mumblecore raps about girls and God\u2019s forgiveness; detested narcotics but got hooked on Xanax after being treated for a mood disorder; and morphed from star student to mopey shut-in, doomscrolling Snap till 3 a.m.\n\nOne night, he wrote his mom a sunny text: \u201cLet\u2019s get coffee [tomorrow] and read our bibles!\u201d Hours later, his grandma found him hunched over his bed. He was fixed in a prayer position, dead. On his phone were saved messages from a Snapchat dealer calling himself Arnoldo_8286. He\u2019d sold Elijah 15 \u201cpercs\u201d via Snap the previous day. All 15 bore fatal doses of fentanyl.\n\nA Long Beach, California, detective, Marc Cisneros, sent a search warrant to Snap two weeks after Eli died. Snap received it on Oct. 8, 2020, but didn\u2019t respond to its merits till February of the following year, when it told Cisneros his warrant was \u201cdeficient.\u201d Cisneros sent Snap a corrected warrant. Finally, Snap sent him \u201ccomms logs and data\u201d pertaining to Arnold\u2019s account \u2014 six months after he filed his first warrant. Whatever was in those logs didn\u2019t avail the detective: His effort to charge Arnold in the death of Elijah was declined by the DA, who didn\u2019t respond to my requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Mendoza says she reached out to Snap through the help-center widget on the app. She begged them to cooperate with Cisneros; Snap sent her back a link titled \u201chow to use memories.\u201d She wrote Snap again, beseeching them to close Arnold\u2019s account \u201cbefore he kills more people.\u201d Snap thanked her for the report and suggested she block him. This went on for months, says Mendoza; she took it upon herself to drive to Snap\u2019s office and file a report in person. But she was never allowed upstairs by Snap\u2019s security, she says. Instead, they threatened to tow her car if she didn\u2019t leave the premises immediately.\n\nAsked about their handling of Mendoza\u2019s pleas, Snap says: \u201cOur heart goes out to Ms. Mendoza for the unimaginable pain she and her family have experienced. Unfortunately Ms. Mendoza did not contact Snap through a support channel, but rather replied to a seasonal or promotional message from Snap; this would likely be why the next message from that source may have been a different seasonal or promotional message.\u201d\n\nUnable to sleep or eat, Mendoza tailed Arnold online. She\u2019d created a fake account, befriended him on Snap \u2014 then reported his every movement to the cops. There he is at a SoCal inn, posting a livestream reel of his \u201cdrugstore\u201d wares: \u201cGot bars \u2026 got oxy \u2026got fuckin\u2019 addys. C\u2019mon, bro: Come shop!\u201d That account stayed up until April 2021, when a reporter from Business Insider called out Snap\u2019s inaction. At last, Snapchat pulled down Arnold\u2019s account \u2014 but he promptly opened a new one and went on dealing, according to screenshots provided by Mendoza.\n\nOne day, Mendoza saw a post on Arnold\u2019s feed; he was on his way to buy himself a car. She raced to the dealership with her spouse, intent on confronting her son\u2019s poisoner. Barging into CarMax, she saw him at a sales desk, filling out the paperwork for his purchase. \u201cI suddenly got sick, like I was gonna faint or throw up,\u201d she says. She stumbled out to summon the police. But Arnold soon came strutting out. His boys were idling in a Chevy Yukon; they hooted out the window when he flashed the keys. Arnold got into his new blue Mazda. Mendoza slumped in the seat of her car, watching as he rounded the corner.\n\nHow many boys and girls must die in their beds before a movement rears its head? For Neville, the answer was: no more. She\u2019d launched a foundation in Alex\u2019s name, appeared at public functions to warn school kids and parents, and lobbied politicians for a suite of new laws to protect young users of social media.\n\nBut busywork\u2019s no substitute for a public burning. On the morning of June 4, 2021, she brought a hundred parents to a park in Santa Monica; carrying signs and banners, they marched on their enemy: Snapchat. For hours, they stood at Snap\u2019s corporate doorstep and shouted in the direction of Evan Spiegel. \u201cWe got on the bullhorn and called him what he is: a coward,\u201d says Jaime Puerta, a small-business owner in Santa Clarita who lost his son Danny in 2020. \u201cJust seeing [that] fucking logo brought the pain back double. But for the first time since our kids died, we broke through, man.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, those parents were media go-to\u2019s on all the morning talk shows. They also succeeded in piercing the veil; Amy Neville got a phone call three days later. \u201cSnap reached out to me,\u201d says Neville. \u201cThey wanted to know the [Snapchat] handle of my son\u2019s killer.\u201d This struck Neville as deeply strange \u2014 and enraged her even all the more. \u201cAs if I would ever help them,\u201d she says. For months, she says, she\u2019d been told that Snap had gone mute while Smokxy went on dealing to Snap\u2019s users. Nonetheless, the feds had a bead on Smokxy, and were about to drop the hammer. They were days from doing a buy-and-bust that would send him down for years, so long as nothing \u2014 and no one \u2014 spooked him.\n\nBut months passed by with no word. Neville wrote a letter to Anne Milgram, the chief of the DEA. She\u2019d lost patience with the agent working her son\u2019s case \u201cafter two years of little or no progress.\u201d As a courtesy to Bodner, though, she sent it to him first. He called the next day with hard news. \u201cI told her that, sadly, Alex was now a cold case,\u201d says Bodner. \u201cWe\u2019d had our crack at Smokxy, but \u2014 something happened.\u201d\n\nWhat happened was this: On the morning of June 7, 2021 \u2014 five days before the planned buy-and-bust from AJ Smokxy, and three days after the parents\u2019 rally outside Snap\u2019s office \u2014 the feds opened Snapchat and found his account \u2026 gone. His profile, his posts, his menus: Every last trace of him was wiped.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d said Neville, gobsmacked, after Bodner told her. Bodner couldn\u2019t explain it \u2014 and he remains furious three years later. \u201cWe\u2019d been on Smokxy for a year, and then, a day or two before we nail him, he goes poof?\u201d\n\nI asked Snap to explain what became of Smokxy\u2019s account. The company says it deleted it on June 5, when its \u201cproactive detection tools\u201d flagged him for \u201cdrug-related activity.\u201d \u201cProactive?\u201d I said. Smokxy had been selling fentanyl for years on Snap, and was implicated in three deaths.\n\nFor now, there\u2019s no way to know why that account suddenly vanished. But that\u2019s what a courtroom trial is for: to determine baseline truths and responsibility. Sometime next year, Neville\u2019s landmark case will begin, barring either a dismissal or a settlement. \u201cWe won\u2019t be bought out,\u201d says Neville, flatly. \u201cAll I care about \u2014 all any of us care about \u2014 is to see what Snap knew and when they knew it. Just getting it out in public will be all the compensation I ever need.\u201d\n\nUntil then, she lives with two hard-hearted facts. AJ Smokxy is still out there, in vanish mode, after serving a gun rap in 2022. And Alexander Neville, forever 14, would have walked across a stage with his friends in June, having graduated from Dana Hills High School. With his hunger for minutiae and a mind that never stopped, he might have moved on to a place like Stanford, where the boys with big ideas and sleepless brains go to rescue or ransack the future.\n\nIf you are concerned about a child\u2019s substance use and need support, education, and resources, please visit the nonprofit organization Hopestream Community at hopestreamcommunity.org.

        "text": "A fentanyl vaccine developed by researchers at the University of Houston is expected to head to clinical trials sometime in the middle of next year, with the hope of being a groundbreaking solution to a deadly crisis.\n\nThe vaccine, which has shown success in animal studies, is designed to stop the highly addictive opioid from entering the brain and causing an overdose. Biopharmaceutical startup Ovax acquired the license to produce and test the vaccine in November 2023 and raised over $10 million toward that effort by June.\n\n\"We're all incredibly excited,\" said Collin Gage, the start-up's co-founder and chief executive officer. He added that his company is starting at \"ground zero,\" but he is confident it will one day have a fentanyl vaccine available to the public.\n\nThat day may be a long time from now. While public health emergencies, like the COVID-19 pandemic, can accelerate a vaccine's development, testing a new vaccine can take anywhere from five to 10 years\u2014sometimes longer.\n\nMeanwhile, fentanyl overdose deaths have been on the rise in Texas, from less than 80 in 2014 to nearly 2,300 in 2023, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The synthetic opioid\u2014made illegally but also available by prescription\u2014is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, making it the deadliest drug in the opioid crisis.\n\nFor fentanyl vaccines, adjuvants are key\n\nThe idea of creating an opioid vaccine has drawn scientific attention since the 1970s. Unlike bacteria or viruses, opioids aren't recognized by our immune systems as foreign invaders. But the immune system can be trained to make antibodies in response to an opioid like fentanyl through a vaccine that links bits of the drug to noninfectious bits of bacteria and uses substances called adjuvants.\n\nAdjuvants are designed to enhance immune response, and are particularly important in vaccines targeting substance use disorders. Past attempts to make these vaccines have been unsuccessful in part because the adjuvants weren't effective enough, said Jay Evans, director of the Center for Translational Medicine at the University of Montana. Evans is also the chief scientific and strategy officer of Inimmune, a Montana-based biotech company developing and testing a variety of vaccines including ones targeting fentanyl and heroin addiction.\n\nThe adjuvant in the University of Houston's fentanyl vaccine is an enterotoxin, a chemical produced by the bacteria Escherichia coli and modified to be noninfectious. It was first developed at Tulane University in Louisiana in the early 2000s and has been used in a variety of vaccines, said Colin Haile, a research associate professor of psychology at the University of Houston who led its fentanyl vaccine development. Haile is also an Ovax co-founder and adviser.\n\n\"It has been in 15 human clinical trials in combination with other vaccines,\" he said, referring to the adjuvant used in his team's vaccine. \"There have been studies in infants where the results have been fantastic, nearly no side effects.\"\n\nOther researchers such as David Dowling and Dr. Ofer Levy, both Ovax co-founders, are using adjuvants that haven't been tested in humans but appear to effectively enhance the immune response to vaccines targeting substance use disorders, at least based on animal studies, Dowling said.\n\nClinical trials littered with challenges\n\nPhase I clinical trials for the University of Houston vaccine are planned to begin in the second quarter of 2025. Ovax is also in licensing negotiations with Boston Children's Hospital for a fentanyl vaccine developed by Dowling and Levy. If those negotiations are successful, Phase I clinical trials could begin in early 2026.\n\nThese trials will aim to establish the vaccine's safety level, potential side effects and optimal dosage. Finding people to take part in them will be a challenge, Evans said.\n\n\"Compared to a normal infectious disease clinical trial, it will be more difficult. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is pretty adamant that you're not going to test this vaccine in healthy individuals that don't already have some sort of opioid addiction,\" he said.\n\n\"So we need to target patients in Phase I who have a history of opioid use disorder, and that's a harder population to try to recruit. It's going to take longer; the patient population will have more adverse events because they're drug users and they will be harder to track.\"\n\nEvans added that the stigma around addiction and drug use might make people reluctant to disclose their condition and participate in a clinical trial.\n\nOvax has yet to decide where it plans to run its Phase I clinical trials, Gage said, but it has been looking at sites in Australia and the Netherlands.\n\n\"We're also looking in the United States,\" he said, \"but it's difficult to find the right patient population.\"\n\nFuture clinical trials would need to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine, who would benefit the most and how long immunity would last.\n\nVaccines as part of the solution\n\nSome critics of fentanyl vaccines say they pull resources from existing treatments for opioid addiction such as buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone. Some have questioned whether people would seek out the vaccine.\n\n\"People have to say they want to be injected, and they have to choose to keep coming back for each injection or infusion,\" Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, told The Washington Post in 2023. \"The vaccines do nothing to reduce craving or withdrawal or to motivate anyone to return for more care.\"\n\nFor Haile, a fentanyl vaccine is not the sole solution but another weapon in the fight against the opioid crisis. He and his colleagues at the University of Houston have conducted animal studies investigating how the vaccine affects treatment with buprenorphine, a medication commonly prescribed to manage withdrawals and drug cravings.\n\nThe findings have yet to be published but are \"quite impressive,\" Haile said, noting fentanyl vaccines could improve the effectiveness of existing treatments.\n\n\"The most important thing to keep in mind is that we're moving as fast as we can go. \u2026 We need to get something to market as quickly as possible to address this terrible problem,\" Haile said. \"The ultimate goal is to protect people and save lives.\"\n\n2024 The Dallas Morning News.

        ],
        "text": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. \u2014 New research from the Indiana University Kelley School of Business explains how pharmaceutical companies were able to saturate the country with massive quantities of opioids, despite efforts by the Drug Enforcement Administration to regulate their supply.\n\nThe research identifies a loophole in the DEA\u2019s monitoring system exploited by some pharmaceutical companies, leading to an oversupply of opioid drugs in communities. The hallmark of this activity was high supply chain complexity, such as pharmacies with dozens of distributors across the country.\n\nThe same research also documents how the opioid epidemic \u2014 commonly regarded as a national public health crisis among white Americans \u2014 had a much deeper impact in Black communities, where overdose deaths tripled from 2014 to 2020.\n\n\u201cWe believe we are the first to uncover insights into the supply chain mechanisms that were used to evade the DEA and fuel the opioid crisis,\u201d said Jonathan Helm, professor of operations and decision technologies and the W.W. Grainger Inc. Faculty Fellow at the Kelley School. \u201cUp until now, the focus has been on each of the pharmaceutical companies individually, ignoring the huge impact of the broader supply chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one was looking at it from a supply chain perspective,\u201d added Iman Attari, a Kelley School doctoral candidate in operations and decision technologies and the paper\u2019s corresponding author.\n\nAttari, Helm and Jorge Mejia, an associate professor in the Kelley School, analyzed information in the 2019 release of the DEA\u2019s Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System \u2014 commonly known as the ARCOS database \u2014 which tracked each shipment in the U.S. opioid supply chain from 2006 to 2014.\n\nTheir paper, \u201cHiding Behind Complexity: Supply Chain, Oversight, Race, and the Opioid Crisis,\u201d appears in the latest issue of the journal Production and Operations Management.\n\nThe researchers uncovered how supply chain complexity may have facilitated the influx of large qualities of opioids into the market, undetected by the DEA. Their research combined ARCOS data about pharmacies\u2019 opioid dispensing and supply chain structures with county-level demographics and socioeconomic factors.\n\nUsing a fixed effect model, they found that a one-unit increase across three dimensions of supply chain complexity was associated with a 16% increase in opioid dispensing.\n\nDEA monitoring involves using ARCOS to collect data on all shipments of controlled substances, and requiring manufacturers and distributors to report suspicious orders of unusual size and frequency.\n\n\u201cThe issue was that pharmacies wanting to have large shipments were very smart about it,\u201d Attari said. \u201cInstead of placing an order for a large shipment from one single distributor, they broke down that large order across multiple distributors. They got smaller shipments from different distributors; when added up, it was a huge order. Each distributor is only going to see the data from the pharmacy that links themselves to it, and not to shipments from other distributors.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the DEA monitoring system failed. By using more suppliers, pharmacies were able to evade detection.\n\nAnother factor they studied was the location of distributors. Because of the DEA\u2019s structure, with 23 often independently operated field divisions spread across the U.S., the researchers found that a lack of coordination and aggregation of information among them was another factor in overlooking potentially suspicious activity.\n\n\u201cEven if a supplier reports a suspicious order in one division, other divisions that the pharmacy orders from are unlikely to be informed,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be just \u2018business,\u2019 because when you look at it from a business standpoint, it makes more sense to work with one distributor because you benefit from economy of scale,\u201d Attari said. \u201cIt is expected for a pharmacy to have one or two distributors, or at most three distributors of opioid drugs.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw pharmacies in the data set with 25 distributors \u2014 all over the U.S. \u2014 that was a strong indication that they were trying to mess with the monitoring system.\u201d\n\nThe research found that supply chain complexity had a stronger association with the increase in opioid dispensing in non-white communities. A 10% increase in the non-white proportion of the population yielded a 3.39% increase in the overall dispensing by pharmacies with high supply chain complexity.\n\n\u201cCommunities of color have been historically under-resourced and neglected by many government and social services,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIn the context of the opioid crisis, it appears that the DEA has spent more effort arresting non-White drug users than on regulating the flow of opioids from pharmaceutical companies into non-White communities.\u201d\n\nTo be certain that their analysis was distinguishing between legitimate medical use and non-medical, recreational demand, they compared statistics for the reformulated OxyContin, which was redesigned to prevent abuse.\n\n\u201cIn a novel approach, we leverage the fact that different pharmacies received their first shipment of reformulated OxyContin at different times and use a difference-in-differences model to estimate the heterogeneous effect of the shock on dispensing,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAs the reformulated OxyContin stifled (non-medical) demand, high-complexity pharmacies experienced a 15.31% greater reduction in dispensing compared to lower-complexity pharmacies, suggesting that their excess dispensing was indeed satisfying non-medical/recreational demand.\u201d\n\nAs a follow-up to this paper, the researchers are investigating the dynamics between major chain pharmacies and their distributors, and how they may facilitate the oversupply by pharmacies. Their initial findings suggest that the pharmacies\u2019 practice of self-distribution, where they distribute opioids from their own distribution centers, combined with their close ties to large distributors, also may have led to excessive opioid dispensing without adequate oversight by the DEA.",

        "text": "BUDAPEST \u2014 Europe is not on the brink of an opioid crisis anytime soon, according to research presented at the 32nd European Congress of Psychiatry (EPA 2024). Deaths from prescription opioid use are nowhere near the level that has been reported in the United States.\n\nLooking at trends in the medical use and abuse of opioid analgesics over the past two decades, Arnt Schellekens, MD, PhD, professor of psychiatry at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, acknowledged that there has been a \"slight rise\" in opioid prescribing in Europe overall. This rise, however, has not translated into an increased mortality rate in most countries.\n\nIndeed, in a retrospective study published 3 years ago in European Psychiatry, Schellekens and colleagues reported that in 15 of the 19 European countries examined, there was no indication of an opioid crisis comparable to that in the US. The exceptions were the United Kingdom (Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England/Wales) and Ireland, which had high rates of adverse opioid-related outcomes.\n\nPrescription opioid use in Europe varies widely, Schellekens, who is also scientific director of the Nijmegen Institute for Scientist-Practitioners in Addiction at Radboud University and director of research for the International Collaboration on ADHD and Substance Abuse consortium, told Medscape Medical News. \"The healthcare systems are so different.\" European countries have different problems to address, and the simple injunction to stop using these drugs is \"not a solution at all,\" he added.\n\nCaution is of course needed when considering opioid use, Schellekens continued. The drugs are associated with a risk for addictive behavior and the development of opioid use disorder. There is generally a good system of care in place across Europe for people who develop opioid-related problems, and this care is reimbursed in the Netherlands, Schellekens said.\n\n\"I'm mainly concerned about the use of synthetic opiates\" such as fentanyl and nitazenes, he added. \"If they come onto the market, then it might be more of an issue.\" Data he presented at EPA 2024 indicated that these drugs are increasingly being used in place of other drugs such as morphine, particularly in the Baltic states. The problem with these drugs is that they are riskier in terms of their tendency to cause addiction, complications, and overdose, said Schellekens.\n\nInappropriate Use\n\nIstv\u00e1n Bitter, MD, PhD, DSc, emeritus chair of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Semmelweis University in Budapest, said at EPA 2024 that he was \"worried\" about the use of certain opioids \"not because of the situation in Hungary, but because of the news we are receiving from other countries in Europe.\"\n\nA colleague working in Northern Europe told Bitter that the semisynthetic opioid oxycodone was being used to treat people with chronic back pain. But opioids would never be considered for this condition in Hungary, said Bitter. Moreover, prior oxycodone use may play a role in the subsequent misuse of benzodiazepines prescribed in an outpatient setting, Bitter observed.\n\nA gateway theory of substance misuse has been advanced, said Schellekens. Although addiction to one drug or behavior could theoretically increase a patient's risk for addiction to another substance, this effect does not necessarily arise. \"If you switch in a proper way, then there's no need to think that the patient will end up with other problems,\" said Schellekens.\n\nPrevention Is Key\n\nPsychiatric disorders, pain, and problematic opioid use are associated with one other. The reasons for this association are complex, and researchers suggest that patients must be screened carefully before they are prescribed opioids.\n\nDespite this association, \"do not deny psychiatric patients adequate analgesia,\" said Schellekens. Patients with a psychiatric comorbidity have been shown to require higher doses of opioids to have an analgesic effect than patients without such a comorbidity do. The former patients thus need a multidisciplinary approach to pain management.\n\nCurrent guidance helps clinicians decide when and how quickly to taper opioids in patients who have developed opioid use disorder. Integral to tapering is the use of psychoeducation and psychosocial support. Data also show that incorporating buprenorphine in place of the opioid being misused may help some patients.\n\nIn summary, long-term opioid use for chronic pain has no place in the treatment of patients with psychiatric comorbidity, said Schellekens. \"On the other hand, you have people that have already escalated their opiates. And then you should not simply stop it. But get in rapport with your patient, write down a tapering plan and schedule, collaborate to get it done.\"\n\nSchellekens and Bitter reported no relevant financial relationships.\n\nSara Freeman is a freelance medical journalist based in London, England.",

        "authors": [],
        "text": "A data-driven intervention that engaged communities to rapidly deploy evidence-based practices to reduce opioid-related overdose deaths \u2013 such as increasing naloxone distribution and enhancing access to medication for opioid use disorder \u2013 did not result in a statistically significant reduction in opioid-related overdose death rates during the evaluation period, according to results from the National Institutes of Health\u2019s HEALing (Helping to End Addiction Long-Term) Communities Study. Researchers identified the COVID-19 pandemic and increased prevalence of fentanyl in the illicit drug market \u2013 including in mixtures with cocaine and methamphetamine \u2013 as factors that likely weakened the impact of the intervention on reducing opioid-related overdose deaths.\n\nThe findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD) meeting on Sunday, June 16, 2024. Launched in 2019, the HEALing Communities Study is the largest addiction prevention and treatment implementation study ever conducted and took place in 67 communities in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio \u2013 four states that have been hard hit by the opioid crisis.\n\nDespite facing unforeseen challenges, the HEALing Communities Study successfully engaged communities to select and implement hundreds of evidence-based strategies over the course of the intervention, demonstrating how leveraging community partnerships and using data to inform public health decisions can effectively support the uptake of evidence-based strategies at the local level.\n\n\u201cThis study brought researchers, providers, and communities together to break down barriers and promote the use of evidence-based strategies that we know are effective, including medications for opioid use disorder and naloxone,\u201d said NIDA director, Nora D. Volkow, M.D. \u201cYet, particularly in the era of fentanyl and its increased mixture with psychostimulant drugs, it\u2019s clear we need to continue developing new tools and approaches for addressing the overdose crisis. Ongoing analyses of the rich data from this study will be critical to guiding our efforts in the future.\u201d\n\nNIH launched the HEALing Communities Study, a four-year, multisite research study to test a set of evidence-based interventions for reducing overdose deaths across health care, justice, and behavioral health settings. Over 100,000 people are now dying annually of a drug overdose, with over 75% of those deaths involving an opioid. Numerous evidence-based practices have been proven to prevent or reverse opioid overdose, but these strategies are gravely underused due to a number of barriers.\n\nAs part of the intervention, researchers collaborated with community coalitions to implement evidence-based practices for reducing opioid overdose deaths from the Opioid-Overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach. These evidence-based practices focus on increasing opioid education and naloxone distribution, enhancing access to medication for opioid use disorder, and safer opioid prescribing and dispensing. The intervention also included a series of communication campaigns to help reduce stigma and increase the demand for evidence-based practices.\n\nCommunities were randomly assigned to either receive the intervention (between January 2020 and June 2022) or to the control group (which received the intervention between July 2022 and December 2023). To test the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing opioid-related overdose deaths, researchers compared the rate of overdose deaths between the communities that received the intervention immediately with those that did not during the period of July 2021 and June 2022.\n\nBetween January 2020 and June 2022, intervention communities successfully implemented 615 evidence-based practice strategies (254 related to overdose education and naloxone distribution, 256 related to medications for opioid use disorder, and 105 related to prescription opioid safety).\n\nDespite the success in deploying evidence-based interventions in participating communities, between July 2021 and June 2022, there was not a statistically significant difference in the overall rate of opioid-involved overdose deaths between the communities receiving the intervention and those that did not, (47.2 opioid-related overdose deaths per 100,000 people in the intervention group, versus 51.7 in the control). The study team is also examining data on the impact of the intervention on total overdose deaths and examining specific drug combinations, such as stimulants and opioids, and on non-fatal opioid overdoses, among other study outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of evidence-based interventions is critical to addressing the evolving overdose crisis,\u201d said Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. \u201cThis study recognizes there is no quick fix to reduce opioid overdose deaths. Saving lives requires ongoing commitment to evidence-based strategies. The HEALing Communities Study facilitated the implementation of 615 evidence-based practice strategies, with the potential to yield lifesaving results in coming years.\u201d\n\nThe authors highlight three specific factors that likely weakened the impact of the intervention on reducing opioid-related overdose deaths. First, the intervention launched two months before the COVID-19 shutdown which severely disrupted the ability to work with health care, behavioral health, and criminal legal systems in implementing evidence-based practices. Indeed, due in large part to the emergence of the COVID-19, only 235 of the 615 strategies (38%) were implemented before the comparison period began in July 2021.\n\nSecond, after communities selected which evidence-based practices they wanted to implement, they only had 10 months to implement them before the comparison period began. The authors note that this was not enough time to robustly recruit necessary staff, change clinical practice workflows, or develop new collaborations across agencies and organizations. They note more time to implement these strategies, and more time between implementation and measuring results, may be needed to observe the full impact of the intervention.\n\nLastly, significant changes in the illicit drug market could have impacted the effectiveness of the intervention. Fentanyl increasingly permeated the illicit drug supply, and was increasingly mixed or used in combination with stimulant drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine, or in counterfeit pills made to look like prescription medications. The increasing use of fentanyl, as well as xylazine, over the study period posed new challenges for treatment of opioid use disorder and opioid-related overdose.\n\n\u201cEven in the face of a global pandemic and worsening overdose crisis, the HEALing Communities Study was able to support the implementation of hundreds of strategies that we know save lives,\u201d said Redonna Chandler, Ph.D., director of the HEALing Communities Study at NIDA. \u201cThis is an incredible feat for implementation science, and shows that when we provide communities with an infrastructure to make data-driven decisions, they are able to effectively implement evidence-based practices based on their unique needs.\u201d\n\nThe HEALing Communities Study was supported and carried out in partnership between the National Institute of Health\u2019s National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) through the NIH HEAL Initiative.\n\nHelping to End Addiction Long-term\u00ae, NIH HEAL Initiative\u00ae, and HEALing Communities Study\u00ae are registered service marks of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

        "text": "South Dakota\u2019s overdose death rate remains the lowest in the nation.\n\nSince 2022, South Dakota has received over $18 million from the national opioid settlement, with $3 million already distributed to programs to combat opioid abuse. This is just the beginning of the state\u2019s efforts to distribute the funds after it was decided that South Dakota would receive more than $54 million over the next 20 years. In 2021, a national opioid settlement was reached to resolve litigation against the three largest pharmaceutical distributors and one manufacturer in the U.S. These companies were accused of fueling the epidemic by distributing excessive amounts of painkillers despite knowing their potential to be addictive.\n\nThe opioid crisis has escalated dramatically over the past few years, becoming one of the most pressing public health challenges in the United States. Fueled by the over-prescription of powerful painkillers, such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, the crisis has led to a surge in addiction, overdoses, and deaths. Synthetic opioids like fentanyl have further intensified the epidemic, being responsible for a significant proportion of recent overdose fatalities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2022 alone, with opioids accounting for nearly 75% of these deaths.\n\nIn the first half of 2024 alone, South Dakota recorded 42 drug overdose deaths, 16 of which were opioid-related. Despite this, the state saw a 27.6% decrease in overall drug overdose deaths compared to the same period in 2023. As of 2024, the state has received $15 million from the settlement and is slated to receive an additional $21.7 million over the next four years.\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s Opioid Abuse Advisory Committee has announced plans for roughly $16.2 million of these funds, including $8.16 million for a program sustainability fund, intended to ensure continuous support for drug treatment and prevention efforts if other federal funds are reduced; $4.5 million for the opioid settlement community grant program, which will fund local organizations\u2019 treatment and prevention programs; $1.88 million for the overdose follow-up program, supporting nonprofits like Emily\u2019s Hope and Project Recovery; $1 million for the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program; $350,000 for a statewide needs assessment to identify service gaps; $150,000 for Naloxone distribution to businesses across the state; and $248,048 for administrative costs. The committee also recommended conducting a statewide needs assessment, with $350,000 allocated for this purpose. This assessment, expected to be completed by the end of 2025, aims to update the state\u2019s understanding of where the most critical service gaps exist.\n\nWith drug overdose deaths in South Dakota dropping, falling from 104 in 2021 to 95 in 2023, state officials are cautiously optimistic that their efforts to combat the crisis are working. However, they remain mindful of the 48% increase in drug overdose deaths since 2014, with fentanyl being the most common drug involved. And it\u2019s only been a short amount of time since the state received these funds.\n\nTiffany Wolfgang, Director of the state\u2019s Division of Behavioral Health, stressed the importance of a careful and strategic approach to utilizing the settlement funds. \u201cWe need to ensure that the initiatives we fund have the most significant impact on our communities,\u201d she stated.\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s overdose death rate remains the lowest in the nation, at 11.3 per 100,000 people, significantly lower than the national average of 32.6 per 100,000. As the state moves forward with its plans, the focus will remain on maintaining this low rate while addressing the evolving challenges of the opioid crisis.\n\nSources:\n\nSD committee plans needs assessment for remainder of $54 million in opioid settlement funds",

        ],
        "text": "In support of President Biden\u2019s Unity Agenda, this HRSA initiative will support rural areas in responding to the opioid crisis; expand the rural substance use treatment workforce; support key populations like adolescents, young adults, and individuals with justice involvement; and respond to rural communities\u2019 needs.\n\nToday, in support of President Biden\u2019s Unity Agenda, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announced the launch of nearly $50 million for HRSA\u2019s Rural Opioid Treatment and Recovery Initiative and released the initiative\u2019s funding application. Funding will support establishing and expanding comprehensive substance use disorder treatment and recovery services in rural areas, including by increasing access to medications for opioid use disorder, such as buprenorphine. Opioid use disorder is particularly concerning in rural communities and accessing treatment can be challenging due to geographic isolation, transportation barriers, and limited substance use disorder providers. This week, HRSA hosted more than 800 rural community leaders working at the grassroots level to build their communities\u2019 capacity to turn the tide of the opioid epidemic.\n\n\u201cThis initiative reflects our unwavering commitment to improve the health and wellbeing of all Americans,\u201d said HHS Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring that people have access to lifesaving care when and where they need it. HRSA\u2019s Rural Opioid Treatment and Recovery Initiative continues to put people at the center of their care, by lowering barriers to accessing treatment and growing a workforce prepared to meet people where they are in their journey of recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cTreatment works and recovery is possible,\u201d said HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson. \u201cThat is why our new HRSA Rural Opioid Treatment and Recovery Initiative prioritizes building and expanding access to opioid use disorder treatment and recovery services in rural communities. We know for these efforts to succeed we need to not only create more rural access to medications to treat opioid use disorder and respond to the challenge fentanyl has created, but also expand support for the rural substance use disorder workforce and increase recovery supports, transportation, employment, and other vital services that make recovery possible. Our initiative offers this comprehensive approach to helping meet rural communities\u2019 needs and creating pathways to recovery.\u201d\n\nHRSA\u2019s awards empower rural awardees to address unique needs and challenges on a local level. Funding will support rural community activities such as mobile units providing MOUD (medication for opioid use disorder) and integration of MOUD prescribing and support into rural primary care settings. Funding also will support rural recovery services such as facilitating supportive employment opportunities for individuals in recovery. Applicants are able to integrate supportive services\u2014such as food access, housing support and employment training and opportunities and other social determinants of health in their grant proposals. Notably, funding can support transportation to facilitate access to treatment and recovery-related appointments as transportation is often a significant barrier to access in rural communities. Applicants also may use funding to expand their rural substance use disorder workforce, including clinical providers and peer support professionals who help individuals find and sustain a path to recovery. Average awards are expected to be up to $750,000 per year over four years.\n\nApplications will be accepted through May 6, 2024, and the funding opportunity is posted at: https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/349409.",

        "text": "Some people who lost family members to opioids expressed shock and sadness, but also a resolve to keep fighting, after the Supreme Court on Thursday torpedoed a massive settlement for victims of the drug crisis.\n\n\"I felt like someone came up and punched me in the stomach,\" Jill Cichowicz, whose twin brother, Scott Zebrowski, collapsed in a California parking lot and died of fentanyl poisoning after he took what he thought was OxyContin in 2017, said.\n\n\"It kind of equated to the day that he died,\" Cichowicz, who founded a nonprofit group called Two in the Stigma, said in an interview that aired on NBC News' \"Hallie Jackson Now.\"\n\nIn a 5-4 decision Thursday, the Supreme Courtblocked a huge bankruptcy reorganization of Purdue Pharma, the company that made and marketed OxyContin, a prescription painkiller that was abused and led to people all over the country getting addicted.\n\nThe majority ruled that the bankruptcy court did not have the authority to release the Sackler family members from opioid victims' legal claims.\n\nBut the deal also included billions for states to abate the crisis and help those who were addicted, as well as $750 million for victims of the opioid crisis.\n\nEdward Neiger, an attorney who is co-managing partner of the law firm ASK LLP and who represents victims of the opioid epidemic, called the setback devastating. He said the opioid epidemic is \"the biggest health care crisis of our time.\"\n\n\"Today we're grieving, we're upset, we're collecting our thoughts, and we're going to regroup,\" Neiger said. \"But I can guarantee you that the victims, and I, are not going to give up.\"\n\nKay Scarpone lost her son, Marine Sgt. Joseph Scarpone, on June 13, 2015, one month shy of his 26th birthday.\n\nJoseph Scarpone had returned from the war in Afghanistan with severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Medication from VA hospitals led him eventually to addiction and to turn to street drugs, Kay Scarpone said.\n\nHe died of an overdose after he took something that was laced with fentanyl, without his knowledge.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely devastated\u201d is how Kay Scarpone, who now lives in New Hampshire and founded the state\u2019s chapter of the nonprofit group Team Sharing, described her reaction to the high court\u2019s ruling.\n\nScarpone said the Purdue Pharma deal was the most money she and others who supported it felt they could get for victims and states. She was part of a victims\u2019 committee tasked with finding people affected by the drug crisis.\n\n\u201cNow we have to go back and tell all these people, 'Sorry, it\u2019s off the table,'\u201d Scarpone said. \u201cIt\u2019s heart-wrenching. We asked these people to trust us.\"\n\nSupreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said the Sacklers could have declared bankruptcy but instead sought to piggyback on the company\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings to resolve pending legal claims.\n\nAs part of the original settlement, the Sacklers, who had controlled Purdue Pharma, had agreed to pay $6 billion that could be used to settle opioid-related claims, but only in return for a complete release from any liability in future cases. No Sacklers have had any involvement in the company since 2019.\n\nThe U.S. Trustee, which oversees bankruptcies under the Justice Department, as well as eight states, Washington, D.C., and the city of Seattle, objected to the Purdue Pharma deal.\n\nThe trustee argued that the liability the Sacklers face could induce voluntary settlements more favorable than those under the plan and that a win for the Sacklers \"would provide a 'roadmap for corporations and wealthy individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system' in future cases,\" Gorsuch wrote in the opinion.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling means settlement talks with the Sacklers would have to begin again, while the separate Purdue Pharma bankruptcy proceedings continue.\n\nIn the aftermath of the decision, the Sackler family, Purdue Pharma and lawyers for the plaintiffs expressed hope that a new deal could quickly be reached.\n\nAn estimated 81,083 people died in the U.S. last year because of opioids, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in May. That class of drugs accounted for the vast majority of the estimated 107,543 overall drug overdose deaths that year.\n\nScarpone described the ruling as going back to the drawing board. She said the delay in the money, which includes money to be used for treatment, will cost lives. But the path forward is clear, she said.\n\n\"The next step is we\u2019re going to fight,\" she said.",

        "text": "In Cuyahoga County, the stark reality of the opioid crisis is that most drug overdose victims die alone, with no one nearby to help.\n\nA recent study, done in partnership with Case Western Reserve University and Cuyahoga County, highlights the critical need for \u201ctargeted harm-reduction strategies\u201d in Northeast Ohio, where the opioid epidemic continues to claim lives at nearly twice the national average.\n\nThose strategies include the distribution of Naloxone (an opioid antagonist that can reverse the effects of an overdose), and increasing the availability of medication-assisted treatment options and fentanyl test strips.\n\nThe research, using data from the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, examined overdose deaths between 2016 and 2020, focusing on people using drugs when they were alone.\n\nThe study revealed that a staggering 75% of overdose victims were using drugs alone, a behavior strongly associated with increased mortality. Key findings indicate that individuals using drugs alone were more likely to be at home and less likely to receive life-saving interventions like naloxone, said Daniel Flannery, the Dr. Semi J. and Ruth Begun Professor and director of the Begun Center for Violence Prevention Research and Education at CWRU\u2019s Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences.\n\n\u201cBeing informed is crucial\u2014knowledge equips you to take action,\u201d Flannery said. \u201cIt\u2019s about reviving someone in need, and if that\u2019s not possible, contacting emergency services immediately. The chances of a fatal outcome significantly increase when there\u2019s no one around to help.\u201d\n\nNew policies and community efforts must prioritize reaching individuals at risk of using alone to curb the devastating impact of the opioid crisis, said Vaishali Deo, research associate at the Begun Center and co-principal investigator in the research.\n\n\u201cOur findings underscore the urgent need for innovative harm-reduction strategies aimed at those most vulnerable\u2014those using drugs alone,\u201d Deo said. \u201cInterventions must focus on reducing isolation and improving access to emergency medical care to prevent further loss of life.\u201d\n\nThe research findings were published by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Library of Medicine.\n\nAdditional insights\n\nIn Cuyahoga County, from 2016 through 2020, there were 2,944 unintentional overdose deaths for those over 18 years old. That\u2019s 54 deaths per 100,000 residents. The national average is 28 overdose deaths per 100,000 residents.\n\nThe study further details the demographics and circumstances surrounding overdose deaths in Cuyahoga County from 2016 to 2020. Most were non-Hispanic (94.9%), white (72.2%) and male (71.3%), with a significant portion 35 to 64 years old. Most lived in the City of Cleveland. Over half attained at least a high school diploma.\n\nToxicology reports revealed that synthetic opioids, specifically illicitly manufactured fentanyl, was present in 72.7% of the deaths. Cocaine and heroin were also significant contributors, found in 41.6% and 29.6% of cases, respectively. Nearly 80% of overdose deaths involved the use of multiple substances.\n\nDespite the presence of bystanders in more than half the cases, most victims (74.9%) were using drugs alone at the time of their fatal overdose, mainly at home. Emergency medical services responded to most of the incidents, yet over 60% of victims were pronounced dead at the scene\u2014highlighting the critical timing needed for interventions like naloxone, which was administered in just 28.6% of the cases.\n\nDeo and Flannery were joined in the research by Sarah Fulton, a research associate at the Begun Center, and Manreet K. Bhullar, a senior forensic epidemiologist at the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, and Thomas P. Gilson, chief medical examiner of Cuyahoga County.\n\n\u201cThese findings paint a stark picture of the opioid crisis in our community,\u201d Gilson said. \u201cThe tragic reality is that too many people are dying alone, and we must act swiftly to implement lifesaving measures that can prevent these unnecessary deaths.\u201d",

        "text": "The health shock of the opioid epidemic in America is a \u201chuge crisis in people\u2019s lives right now,\u201d a University of Notre Dame researcher said.\n\nAnd it undeniably is. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug overdose deaths in the United States topped 100,000 in 2022 \u2014 with nearly 83,000 of those deaths involving opioids. And over the past two decades, mortality from opioid overdoses in the U.S. has increased at an alarming rate, claiming the lives of more than 645,000 individuals. In that same 20-year period, nearly 280,000 people died from overdoses involving prescription opioids.\n\nVicky Barone, assistant professor of economics at Notre Dame, along with her co-author Carolina Arteaga, assistant professor of economics at the University of Toronto, researched the origins and development of the opioid epidemic and found that the unregulated marketing of potent painkillers led to increased access to prescription opioids and subsequent overdose mortalities. The two researchers then traced the long-term consequences of opioid overdose deaths on the political landscape in America, finding an increased support for conservative beliefs and Republican candidates.\n\nTheir research culminated in two working papers completed this academic year: \u201cA Manufactured Tragedy: The Origins and Deep Ripples of the Opioid Epidemic\u201d and \u201cThe Political Consequences of the Opioid Epidemic.\u201d\n\nIn their first study, \u201cA Manufactured Tragedy,\u201d the researchers examined areas of the country that witnessed high rates of opioid prescriptions when opioids first entered the market in the mid-1990s. They found that Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin \u2014 a prescription opioid that is a highly potent and addictive painkiller \u2014 intentionally and aggressively targeted the marketing of its drug to areas with high cancer mortality rates to treat cancer pain.\n\nAccording to the researchers, unsealed court records drawn from litigation against Purdue Pharma indicated a strategy by the pharmaceutical company to expand their marketing efforts from the cancer pain market to the much larger non-cancer pain market in those same geographic areas. This meant that physicians and patients not involved in cancer exposure or treatment would then be targeted by OxyContin promotion, the researchers said, and would eventually gain access to potent prescription opioids to treat moderate and chronic pain.\n\nIn the years following that initial marketing campaign, those targeted communities suffered from deadly opioid drug overdoses more than any other towns across the country, Barone and Arteaga calculated. Focusing on those areas already experiencing cancer mortality, the researchers found that there was a 55 percent increase in prescription opioid deaths and a 33 percent increase in deaths from all opioids. As noted in the study, the CDC determined that opioid prescriptions reached their peak in 2012; however, mortality from prescription opioids rose for another five years to reach its maximum in 2017, and deaths involving any opioids were at an all-time high in 2021.\n\nThe researchers explained that the opioid crisis quickly spiraled out of control due to several factors. First of all, it was not initially or fully understood how addictive the opioids were and how risky it was to prescribe and use them without stricter dosing parameters. Second, there was a spread of misinformation regarding any such risks or dangers of addiction surrounding their use. Third, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lacked oversight in terms of how the drugs were marketed. And finally, once the drugs hit the black market, there was no controlling how and how many of them were distributed within the community.\n\nBuilding on the research from that first study, Barone and Arteaga turned the focus of their second study toward the opioid epidemic\u2019s connection to political perceptions and whether or not the \u201chealth shocks\u201d of drug overdose deaths occurring in those affected communities influenced how their members chose to vote.\n\nFocusing on the period between 1982 and 2020, including the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections \u2014 as well as any congressional elections within that period \u2014 the researchers documented a causal relationship between those areas experiencing epidemic-related health shocks and an increased support of the Republican party and its values.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers discovered that the opioid epidemic increased Republican vote shares and started to flip elections in the early 2000s. In areas hit harder by the opioid epidemic, Barone explained, there was more support for Republican candidates and a higher Republican vote share, which translated into Republicans winning additional seats in the House from 2012 until 2020, in addition to an increase in House members who tend to hold more conservative views.\n\n\u201cThe opioid epidemic has shaped the views of the American population in terms of who voters are supporting,\u201d Barone said. \u201cAnd from electoral survey data, we see a real shift toward more conservative beliefs in the areas affected most by the shock of high opioid mortality rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe opioid epidemic has shaped the views of the American population in terms of who voters are supporting. And from electoral survey data, we see a real shift toward more conservative beliefs in the areas affected most by the shock of high opioid mortality rates.\u201d\n\nThese effects are explained by changes in voter views rather than voter composition, the study said. For example, when voters were asked what their views were on abortion, gun control and immigration policy, those who were more exposed to the effects of the opioid epidemic had stronger feelings in alignment with those of conservatives.\n\nThe researchers offered one potential explanation for this shift: the perceived greater effectiveness of the Republicans\u2019 approach to curbing the opioid epidemic over the Democrats\u2019 approach. The Republican party favors increased law enforcement to curb drug trafficking and crime, while Democrats prefer harm reduction policies and funding increases for opioid abuse treatment and recovery.\n\nIt is important to note that the original opioid epidemic has transformed over the past several years to become a fentanyl epidemic \u2014 fentanyl being a synthetic opioid that can be deadly even in small doses and is found on the street rather than being prescribed. Barone explained that the idea of keeping these particular drugs out of the country altogether resonated with the public, boosting support for the Republican party\u2019s directive.\n\n\u201cThe Republican response was generally more appealing to the public,\u201d Barone said. \u201cAnd in places where people were more exposed to the epidemic, it made more sense in their minds.\u201d\n\nThe co-authors concluded that the potential effects of the increased supply of prescription opioids stretches beyond the uptick in overdose deaths and touches communities in health, economic and social dimensions, \u201cand indicates how it will continue to shape these communities through its effects on their elected officials and intergroup perceptions.\u201d",

        "text": "Addressing the overdose crisis\n\nIn 2022, nearly 108,000 people died from drug overdoses, which equates to 296 overdoses each day.1 More than 3 out of 5 overdose deaths had at least one potential opportunity to link people to care before the fatal overdose or to implement life-saving actions when the fatal overdose occurred.2\n\nDrug overdose deaths can be prevented. See how CDC is working to prevent overdoses and substance use-related harms with the following strategies.\n\nSix guiding principles and five strategic priorities guide CDC's work\n\nMission: Prevent Overdoses and Substance Use-Related Harms\n\nGuiding principles\n\nPromote health equity\n\nAll individuals have the right to be as healthy as possible. CDC is committed to ensuring everyone has an equitable opportunity to prevent overdose and substance use-related harms and remains dedicated to addressing and ending health disparities related to the overdose crisis. CDC also promotes actions to advance health equity to ensure all communities can fight the overdose crisis together.\n\nAddress underlying factors\n\nMany factors contribute to harms associated with substance use while other factors can be protective. CDC is committed to identifying these factors to better design and focus interventions to address the overdose crisis, while attending to health disparities and inequities.\n\nPartner broadly\n\nAddressing the overdose crisis requires partnering with multiple sectors and organizations within all of CDC's strategic priorities. Partnerships provide opportunities to develop, coordinate, and implement targeted strategies to prevent harm. CDC is dedicated to broad and diverse partnerships as a foundation of preventing overdose and substance-use related harms.\n\nTake evidence-based action\n\nTo better address the overdose crisis, CDC promotes strategies that have been extensively researched by scientists. Evidence-based action ensures the delivery (or implementation) of effective methods for preventing and reducing overdose and substance use-related harms that are translated and adapted for diverse audiences and settings.\n\nAdvance science\n\nContinuing to build the evidence-base for what works to prevent overdose and substance-use related harms is critical to ending the overdose crisis. By advancing science through supporting public health surveillance, identifying risk and protective factors, developing and evaluating prevention strategies, and ensuring effective communication strategies that are adapted for diverse audiences, CDC is committed to building the evidence-base for what works to end the overdose crisis.\n\nDrive innovation\n\nThe overdose crisis will require new and innovative ideas to prevent overdose and substance use-related harms. CDC promotes the generation, implementation, evaluation, and widespread adoption of innovative ideas to address the overdose crisis in all areas of its work.\n\nStrategic priorities\n\nMonitor, analyze, and communicate trends\n\nTimely, high-quality data help public health officials and other decision-makers understand the extent of the problem, focus resources where they are needed most, particularly among populations disproportionately affected by overdose, and evaluate the success of overdose and substance use-related harm prevention efforts. Recognizing the importance of data, CDC is helping jurisdictions track overdose-related morbidity and mortality as well as use data to inform prevention activities.\n\nBuild state, tribal, local, and territorial capacity\n\nStates, tribes, local communities, and territories play an important role in preventing overdoses and substance use-related harms. They provide public health leadership; drive innovation; partner and collaborate; leverage surveillance to detect trends; and promote education, prevention (i.e., primary, secondary, and tertiary), and treatment. CDC works with jurisdictions to build their capacity in these and other areas to respond to the overdose crisis.\n\nSupport providers, health systems, payors, and employers\n\nProviders and health systems are crucial in promoting safer opioid prescribing and more effective and equitable pain management among adults and youth as well as providing evidence-based treatment for substance use disorders, particularly among disproportionately affected populations. In addition, health systems can implement quality improvement measures to track their efforts, integrate these measures into their electronic health records, and support care coordination.\n\nPrivate and public insurers and pharmacy benefit managers can help address the overdose crisis by addressing gaps in coverage, removing barriers to treatment for substance use disorders and pain treatments, and conducting drug utilization reviews. Employers can play a critical role in preventing overdose by offering comprehensive benefits and supporting employees affected by substance use disorders.\n\nPartner with public safety and community organizations\n\nCDC continues to build multidisciplinary and diverse partnerships through public health and public safety collaborations at national, state, and local levels to strengthen efforts to reduce drug overdoses. These partnerships allow for effective and equitable implementation of programs and help advance promising strategies that address the overdose crisis, while helping to eliminate the longstanding impact of systemic inequities on overdose prevention.\n\nFor example, public safety collaborations can reach individuals during critical times such as involvement with the criminal justice system. In addition, partnerships with community organizations can link individuals to substance use disorder treatment or reduce substance use-related harms. These opportunities can bridge knowledge, data, and service gaps that impact the success of community-wide overdose prevention actions.\n\nRaise public awareness and reduce stigma\n\nCDC prioritizes raising awareness about all aspects of substance use including the risks of substance use and preventing associated harms among persons who use drugs, their families, and communities. In addition, CDC promotes evidence-based treatment for substance use disorders and advances understanding that addiction is a chronic disease.\n\nCDC also works to reduce stigma because stigma prevents people from seeking help for substance use disorders. CDC reduces stigma by addressing misinformation, endorsing non-stigmatizing language, and promoting awareness of stigma's impact including among populations disproportionately affected by substance use and overdose.",

So our neighbor would wear this watch, it collects data, it sends it to a cloud-based environment and we leverage that data to be able to personalize a treatment approach for that individual.\n\nDavod Owens is the Chief Medical Officer at Nexalin Technology.\n\nHe presented a piece of medical equipment that is currently waiting for FDA approval.\n\nA sort of headband that stimulates the brain.\n\nIt works quite well for substance use disorder. It cuts way down on cravings. It gives people sleep at night which is one of the biggest problems people have early on.\n\nIt uses electrical signals through the forehead and sides of the head.\n\nAnd it fits just right on your head, and it gives electrical stimulation here and here. That will go and penetrate your entire brain, right down to your brainstem.\n\nThe opioid crisis is not just a problem in eastern North Carolina, however, both medical professionals and the Sheriff's Office see it.\n\nDr. Kerry Willis is a primary care physician in Carteret County.\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of desperate moms and desperate dads.

        "text": "Over the past 5 years, Connecticut has led nationwide efforts to secure more than $50 billion nationwide to combat the opioid epidemic, including $600 million for Connecticut alone to support treatment, prevention, and recovery. That money has begun to flow. Connecticut\u2019s Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee, comprised of health professionals, individuals with lived experience, and state and municipal leaders is responsible for allocating and accounting for opioid settlement funds. Here\u2019s more information on each case.\n\nWATCH: Attorney General Tong testifies to U.S. House committee on Sackler family abuse of bankruptcy laws\n\nSummary of Key Cases\n\nPublicis: In February 2024, Attorney General Tong announced a $350 million national settlement with Publicis Health to resolve investigations into the global marketing and communications firm\u2019s role in the prescription opioid crisis.\n\nWalmart: InNovember 2022, Attorney General Tong announced Connecticut had reached a $3.1 billion agreement with Walmart to resolve allegations that the company contributed to the opioid addiction crisis by failing to appropriately oversee the dispensing of opioids at its stores.\n\nCVS and Walgreens: In December 2022, Attorney General Tong announced a $10.7 billion agreement with CVS and Walgreens.\n\nEndo: In August 2022, Attorney General Tong announced an agreement in principle with opioid maker Endo International and its lenders that would provide up to $450 million to participating states and local governments for treatment and prevention, ban promotion of Endo\u2019s opioids, and require Endo to turn over millions of documents related to its role in the opioid crisis for publication in a public online archive.\n\nAllergan: In July 2022, Attorney General Tong announced a $2.37 billion agreement framework with Allergan and states regarding the generic drug manufacturer\u2019s role in the opioid epidemic.\n\nTeva: In July 2022, Attorney General Tong announced a $4.25 billion agreement framework with Teva Pharmaceuticals and states regarding the generic drug manufacturer\u2019s role in the opioid epidemic.\n\nPurdue Pharma and the Sacklers: Attorney General Tong announced in March 2022 that Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family will pay $6 billion to victims, survivors, and states for their role in the opioid epidemic. Connecticut will receive up to $95 million to support opioid treatment and prevention and provide aid to victims and survivors. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the bankruptcy plan for Purdue Pharma over concerns about the protections from civil lawsuits that the plan grants the Sacklers.\n\nDistributors and Johnson & Johnson: In July 2021, Attorney General Tong announced an historic $26 billion agreement with pharmaceutical distributors Cardinal, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen and manufacturer Johnson & Johnson to bring desperately needed resources to fight the opioid crisis. Connecticut will receive approximately $300 million as part of the landmark settlement.\n\nMcKinsey: In February 2021, Attorney General Tong announced Connecticut had helped lead a coalition of attorneys general from 47 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories in a $573 million settlement with McKinsey & Company. Connecticut will receive $7,513,087.22, which will be used to abate the opioid epidemic.",

        "authors": [],
        "text": "Jan. 17, 2024\n\nOpioid addiction, also called opioid use disorder (OUD), has become a top national public health concern. According to the American Medical Association (AMA), 3% to 19% of individuals exposed to opioids develop chronic dependency. Certain risk factors can increase these odds. The most severe OUD complication is fatal overdose, which occurs every six minutes in the U.S. Opioid-related overdoses are now the driving cause of accidental death in adults under age 45 and have lowered average American life expectancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Approximately 1 in 5 Americans knows someone who has died due to the effects of this drug class, according to the Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2017.\n\nIt is imperative that the medical community identifies mechanisms to balance these drugs' medicinal powers with their toxicity, says Holly L. Geyer, M.D., a hospitalist and addiction medicine specialist at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. Dr. Geyer chairs the Mayo Clinic Arizona Opioid Stewardship Program, is the editor of the patient education book Ending the Crisis: Mayo Clinic's Guide to Opioid Addiction and Safe Opioid Use, and is a contributor to the Mayo Clinic Opioid Resource Center.\n\nOver-prescribing remains an opioid epidemic contributor\n\nOpioid prescribing soared from the 1990s to early 2000s. By 2015, more than 1 in 3 U.S. adults received an opioid prescription. But national prescribing trends stabilized as prescribers acclimated to prescribed opioids' addictive potential, according to a 2017 publication in Annals of Internal Medicine. However, a parabolic rise in opioid-related overdoses continues trending upward today as patients dependent on opioids who became unable to access opioids from their prescribers turned to the illicit drug market.\n\n\"Multiple early studies have shown more than 80% of individuals who move to illicit opioids \u2014 particularly heroin \u2014 started on prescription opioids, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse,\" Dr. Geyer explains. \"Roughly half of them obtain these from friends or family through diversion.\"\n\nA Mayo Clinic quality improvement project identified that patients who had surgery consumed an average of one-third of opioids provided; 70% of patients with leftovers stored them for future use.\n\n\"Leftover opioids cause problems, especially when used for indications other than prescribed,\" says Dr. Geyer. \"They are particularly dangerous when they get into the hands of kids who can't handle the dose or potency.\"\n\nPatient, indication, dose, route and length of treatment matter\n\nDr. Geyer views opioid stewardship as a central tool to prevent opioid addiction.\n\n\"Opioid stewardship requires healthcare professionals' understanding of the critical role they play as opioid gatekeepers,\" says Dr. Geyer.\n\nPreventing OUD requires that healthcare professionals pay attention to details. Patients also need OUD screening to ensure appropriate treatment and to prevent opioids from entering the illicit market.\n\nFactors that significantly increase addiction risk include:\n\nYounger age, or patients ages 18 to 45.\n\nChronic pain.\n\nPersonal or family substance misuse history, including tobacco.\n\nMental health disorders.\n\nLife stressors.\n\nProlonged opioid use for more than 7 days.\n\nDr. Geyer explains that it is an opioid prescriber's responsibility to ensure administration of this medication to the right patient. Additionally, the prescriber must make certain the prescription is for the right indication and prescribed at the right dose, route and treatment length, as follows:\n\nThe right indication\n\nEnsuring an opioid prescription for the right indication is critical. Multiple studies have concluded that opioids offer little value for chronic pain, often defined as pain present more than 45 days. Further, these studies often found that opioids worsen symptoms through opioid-induced hyperalgesia.\n\n\"We've learned a lot in the past two decades about which conditions respond to which pain regimens,\" says Dr. Geyer. \"Many studies have found nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen to be as effective as opioids for acutely painful condition management and some post-surgical states. Disease indication-based practice protocols limit unnecessary opioid exposure.\"\n\nThe right dose, route and treatment length\n\nTailoring prescription length is key for OUD prevention. A CDC study showed a one-day opioid prescription carries a 6% chance the person will still use the opioid at one year, according to a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in 2017. If the healthcare professional increases to an eight-day prescription, the risk goes up to 13.5%. A monthlong prescription drives the risk to 30%. For every opioid prescription refill, risk of ongoing use at one-year doubles.\n\nOpioid administration route is also impactful. For inpatients, an oral route rather than intravenous limits the euphoric surge patients may experience when first-pass metabolism is bypassed.\n\n\"Studies have shown that patients experiencing euphoria after opioid use are more likely to develop addiction,\" Dr. Geyer adds.\n\nRemaining mindful of these opioid prescription factors in medical practice is complex; it is important to approach each case individually, says Dr. Geyer.\n\n6 key actions in opioid stewardship\n\nAfter screening patients to ensure opioid appropriateness, Dr. Geyer recommends the 2022 CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain and its suggestions for good opioid stewardship:\n\nCheck the prescription drug monitoring program. Look for multiple prescriber history, which may suggest doctor shopping. Watch for history of other controlled substances such as benzodiazepines or muscle relaxants, which could increase opioid overdose risk.\n\nEducate through risk-benefit discussions, ensuring that patients understand opioid use guidelines. Patients prescribed opioids must know when to take them; what to avoid, such as sedatives and alcohol; and what to monitor for, such as constipation, addiction and overdose. Patients also must be informed about the importance of locking up opioids to make them inaccessible to others and how to immediately dispose of unused pills.\n\nAlways pair an opioid with a nonopioid alternative. Consider scheduling acetaminophen or NSAIDs round-the-clock to reduce opioid need. Nonpharmacologic therapies such as physical therapy, daily exercise, heat therapy and massage therapy can be used as adjuncts.\n\nAvoid opioid use for chronic or undifferentiated pain. If patients require opioid therapy beyond 45 days or have no obvious symptom driver, consider referring to a pain management specialist for unexplored alternatives and adjunctives.\n\nOffer naloxone. Offer this medication to all patients receiving opioid prescriptions, especially if they have a history of breathing problems, kidney or liver dysfunction, or substance use disorder.\n\nDevelop rapport with the patient. Dr. Geyer says she feels the best opioid addiction prevention strategy is an open and honest relationship with the patient.\n\nFor more information\n\nAMA Alliance.

        "authors": [],
        "text": "95% Identify Synthetic Opioids such as Fentanyl as Serious Public Health Issue\n\nRate of Pursuing Treatment for Opioid Abuse Nearly Doubles in 4 Years\n\nMajority say Doctors More Careful in Prescribing Opioids; But, 64% say Government NOT Doing as Much as It Can to Address Opioid Abuse\n\nPress Release Crosstabs\n\nLoudonville, NY. Sixty-eight percent, or two-in-three New York residents have been touched by opioid abuse, meaning they either know someone in their lives who has abused opioids or personally know someone who has died due to an opioid overdose, according to a recent poll of New Yorkers by the Siena College Research Institute (SCRI). This is an increase from 2020, when 59% had been touched by opioids. Today 72% of state residents say that the problem of opioid abuse has gotten worse in the past few years.\n\n\u201cMajorities across each region of New York State say that opioid abuse is a serious problem in their area, including New York City (81%), the downstate suburbs (68%), upstate (81%) and the Capital Region (79%), and 80% continue to agree that the U.S. is in the middle of an opioid epidemic. Shockingly, one-in-three, 36%, now know someone who has died from an opioid overdose,\u201d said Don Levy, SCRI\u2019s Director.\n\nNew Yorkers identify that there has been a shift in the awareness and usage of prescription opioids in the past four years. By a margin of 58-21%, they say that doctors are now more careful in their prescribing of opioids since 2020, and 66% say that the awareness of the dangers of prescription pain medicine has grown. Only 19% of residents in 2024 say that they had been prescribed opioids by a doctor in the previous 2 years, down ten points from 2020. Still, only 23% say that fewer people are dying from opioid overdoses.\n\nThe issue of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has become a dominant focus for New Yorkers in their thinking about the opioid crisis. A plurality, 49 percent, report that when they hear people discussing the \u2018Opioid Crisis\u2019, they primarily think of \u201cthe abuse of illegal substances including heroin that are laced with synthetic opioids such as fentanyl\u201d, as opposed to prescription opioids (25%) or heroin by itself (18%). Additionally, 95% of New Yorkers say that the growing prevalence of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl is either a \u2018very\u2019 (70%) or \u2018somewhat\u2019 (25%) serious public health issue.\n\n\u201cFentanyl has become a serious concern in the minds of New Yorkers all across the state,\u201d Levy said. \u201cPlaced in a list with other public health issues such as alcohol abuse, mental illness, obesity, e-cigarette use, or other opioids, \u2018the growing prevalence of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl\u2019 rises to the top, with 70% of all NY\u2019ers describing it as \u2018very serious.\u2019 Ninety-two percent say that the current crisis is more insidious than other crises as overdosing on opioids including heroin and fentanyl is killing people at previously unheard of rates. Three-quarters of the state support adding fentanyl analogs to New York\u2019s controlled substances list.\u201d\n\nAmong those who have been prescribed opioids, 42% report pursuing treatment for opioid abuse, nearly doubled from 23% in 2020. A plurality, 41-30%, of New York residents report that since 2020, treatment for opioid addiction is easier to obtain. This plurality holds for those living in urban and suburban areas, and those with full time employment, but does not for those from rural areas, part-time employment, those who are unemployed, and those who are retired. While many New Yorkers say that treatment is easier to obtain, a significant number report that barriers remain in place for those accessing opioid treatment. They say that insurance refusing coverage for treatment (46%), treatment programs not working with individuals for long enough (44%), and poor follow-up after patients complete treatment (42%) are all barriers to people in their area receiving treatment for opioid abuse \u2013 each virtually unchanged from 2020 and 2018.\n\nOver half of New Yorkers, 55%, say that major institutions including hospitals, treatment centers, law enforcement, schools and government entities are now working collaboratively to address opioid abuse. Yet, by 64-36%, they say that governmental entities across New York are not doing as much as they can to address opioid abuse. A majority says that New York\u2019s Office for Addiction Services and Supports is doing only a fair (37%) or poor (22%) job handling the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cA significant portion of New Yorkers are dissatisfied with the current government response to the opioid crisis,\u201d Levy said, \u201cbut when comparing their responses to previous years, large majorities still support, either \u2018a great deal\u2019 or \u2018some,\u2019 actions such as allocating more funding for treatment and rehabilitation, providing more funding for law enforcement aimed at lessening the availability of illegal opioids, and increasing the severity of sentences for those convicted for trafficking in illegal opioids. While 73% say they favor harm reduction strategies, only 59% support increasing support for needle exchange programs and fewer, 46% support safe injection sites.\u201d\n\nThe survey is part of a community effort by Prescription for Progress: United against opioid addiction, a coalition of leaders in healthcare, media, law enforcement, education and business in New York\u2019s Capital Region committed to raising awareness and taking positive steps to address the opioid crisis.

        "text": "The opioid crisis doesn\u2019t get as many headlines as it used to before Covid-19, but the news remains stubbornly, shockingly bad.\n\nDecades into the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in American history, people are dying at higher rates than ever. Between 2017 and 2021, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids jumped from 47,600 to 80,411 \u2014 many more Americans than are killed each year by guns or cars. The surge has been largely driven by powerful synthetics like fentanyl, an opioid 50 times more potent than heroin.\n\nProvisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show nearly as many opioid-involved overdose deaths in 2022, at 79,770. Overdoses in Black, American Indian, and Latinx communities have been rising even faster, widening the mortality gap between white people and people of color. In 2020, Black men 65 and older died of overdoses at seven times the rate of white men in the same age range.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of Americans struggling with opioid addiction remains staggering. In 2022, 6.1 million people 12 and older had an opioid use disorder, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s most recent annual survey, while 8.9 million reported misusing opioids within the past year.\n\nLooking at these statistics, I thought back to something that addiction specialist Sarah Wakeman told me when I was reporting on the opioid crisis five years ago. \u201cMost people get better,\u201d Wakeman, who is the senior medical director for substance use disorder at Mass General Brigham, said then. \u201cThat\u2019s what we don\u2019t ever talk about in the opioids conversation.\u201d\n\nWhen she says \u201cmost people,\u201d she means most people who get long-term medication-assisted treatment (MAT), widely considered the gold standard in addiction care. It combines regular counseling and behavioral therapy with the medication methadone or buprenorphine (often prescribed under the brand name Suboxone). Both contain synthetic opioid compounds, which prevent withdrawal and cravings, and they can lower overdoses by as much as 76 percent. (A third medication, less often used, is naltrexone, which blocks the high from opioids.)\n\nThe philosophy of MAT \u2014 a departure from the moralizing, abstinence-based rehab and 12-step programs that dominated addiction care for most of the 20th century \u2014 began to take shape in the early 2000s, when the Food and Drug Administration approved buprenorphine and a federal law authorized primary care physicians to prescribe it.\n\nMAT shifted the treatment paradigm dramatically. Now, every overdose death is a tragedy, Wakeman told me, not because opioid addiction is unsolvable but because, like so many other chronic illnesses, it\u2019s now very treatable.\n\nSo why have we failed to stop or even significantly slow the opioid crisis? Why do nearly 90 percent of those with opioid use disorder still lack access to evidence-based treatment like MAT?\n\nThis fall, I got back in touch with Wakeman and posed this question. Is the problem us, I asked her, or is it the opioids? \u201cOh, it\u2019s definitely us,\u201d she said. The addiction crisis is as much an \u201cideological challenge\u201d as it is a medical one.\n\n\u201cWe, as a society, have spent more than 100 years thinking of and building policies and systems and punishments to address addiction as if it were an issue of morality,\u201d Wakeman said. \u201cAnd so even though now we\u2019re starting to talk about it as a public health issue, our policies, our clinical approaches, our care models, our funding, really reflect this idea that we actually think people are doing something bad and so we should make it really hard on them.\u201d\n\nThis punitive mindset contributes to a disproportionate emphasis on detox, \u201cwhich happens to be the most lucrative, least effective element of recovery,\u201d as Walter Ling, a UCLA psychiatrist and neurologist whose research helped pave the way for FDA approval of buprenorphine and other opioid addiction medications, put it in a recent op-ed. Even now, many drug rehab centers stress detoxification, meaning going off opioids rapidly, over MAT. A 2020 nationwide survey of inpatient programs found that only 29 percent offered a long-term MAT option; only one in eight residential treatment facilities for adolescents offered buprenorphine for long-term treatment, according to a study last June.\n\nNearly every clinician I spoke to offered some version of this same observation about how culture and ideology restrict addiction care. \u201cThe main thing that\u2019s holding us back is stigma,\u201d said Brown University epidemiologist Josiah Rich, an adviser to the Rhode Island task force on overdoses, who has spent decades providing HIV and addiction care to people locked up in the state\u2019s prisons.\n\nPhysician and anthropologist Kimberly Sue, a professor at Yale and the author of Getting Wrecked: Women, Incarceration, and the American Opioid Crisis, told me about treating young people jailed at Rikers Island whose families had cut them off or kicked them out for using drugs. \u201cThe US is extremely culturally punitive,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, \u2018Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.\u2019 \u2018You made your bed, you lie in it.\u2019 \u2026 We\u2019re told that you\u2019re a loser, you don\u2019t deserve to live because you use drugs. You don\u2019t deserve to be healthy.\u201d\n\nOur approach to treatment hasn\u2019t caught up with the science of what works best. \u201cUntil the medications came around, our treatment for opioid addiction was mostly a failure,\u201d Ling told me. \u201cYet we put our philosophy, our idea, ahead of science, ahead of what we know.\u201d That trickles down into how people interact with the health care system \u2014 and how structural barriers like racism and poverty compound the damage for those most susceptible to addiction.\n\nThe war on drugs laid the foundation for dysfunctional addiction treatment\n\nThe face of opioid addiction in America changed dramatically over the past two decades. As overdoses soared in white and rural communities and the crisis was no longer concentrated in cities or communities of color, public discourse around addiction shifted. Experts and policymakers began talking urgently about \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d among working-class white people, and a surge of sympathetic media attention sought to understand the problem through this new wave of victims. Americans increasingly began to see addiction the same way medical authorities had for decades \u2014 as an illness.\n\nEven so, our treatment paradigm has not caught up. Perhaps the clearest example of how Americans\u2019 cultural mindset limits access to treatment is the onerous regulation of methadone. Patients can receive the medication only at federally certified clinics, which tend to be located in impoverished or high-crime neighborhoods. Most patients must appear at the clinic daily for months or years before they\u2019re allowed to take home even a small number of doses. This means waiting in line, often for hours, missing appointments and work, having to arrange for child care. For some patients, it also means long commutes, sometimes across state lines.\n\nIn stark contrast, buprenorphine can be prescribed in doctors\u2019 offices and dispensed by pharmacies. Although the overdose risk with methadone is slightly higher than for buprenorphine, it is stigma, not science, that guides methadone regulations. The medication was initially introduced in the US in 1947 as a pain reliever and cough suppressant; researchers established its effectiveness at treating opioid addiction during the 1960s, amid a spike in heroin use that devastated Black urban communities. Back then, even more than now, Americans viewed addiction through the lens of criminality and deviance rather than disease, so federal regulations put in place in the early 1970s, just as Richard Nixon declared the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d walled off methadone from mainstream medical settings. That\u2019s where it remains today, even though in countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia, where primary care doctors have been prescribing methadone for decades, it\u2019s treated more like a normal medication.\n\nThe long lines outside methadone clinics is one of the main reasons people drop out of or never begin treatment with the medication. Because of these restrictions, methadone is \u201clegendarily hated\u201d among drug users, New York University sociologist David Frank, who is in recovery himself and has been taking methadone for 20 years, told me.\n\nIn a recent study he published, one participant compared methadone treatment to \u201cliquid handcuffs,\u201d while another described the degrading experience of being told to keep waiting in line after her water broke. \u201cTreatment is not set up to meet the actual needs of the population,\u201d Frank said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a barrier to meeting those needs.\u201d Most people come to treatment not because of a commitment to abstinence or even to cure a disease, but \u201cto deal with the fact that the drug they\u2019re dependent on is highly criminalized,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my research, this comes up time and again. I ask people, why did you get on methadone? And they always tell the same story as mine: \u2018I\u2019m dope sick every day, it\u2019s impossible. I get arrested, I\u2019m scared, my life is falling apart.\u2019 It\u2019s a very pragmatic response. Methadone helps reduce those problems.\u201d\n\nThe punitive regulations flow largely from methadone\u2019s history, providers say, from a time when heroin use was closely associated with Black Americans. When buprenorphine received FDA approval 40 years later, the opioid crisis was hitting white America, too. \u201cPeople\u2019s perceptions about methadone are really frozen in history,\u201d said Paul Joudrey, a Pittsburgh-based addiction care doctor who, along with Frank, is on the board of the National Coalition to Liberate Methadone.\n\nBuprenorphine prescribers are far more common in segregated white communities, while methadone clinics are more prevalent in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Patients who are white, wealthy, and well-educated are more likely than Black or Hispanic patients to receive buprenorphine. Patients of color are often directed instead to methadone clinics \u2014 and even when they do receive buprenorphine, the average course of treatment is shorter.\n\nOur very ideas of what it means to recover are still bound up with the stigmatized, criminalized history of addiction. A common misconception among the public, experts told me, and even some care providers and people who use drugs themselves, is that recovery with buprenorphine or methadone isn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d recovery; that it just replaces one addiction with another.\n\n\u201cWe think of addiction, which is a lifetime-long problem, as being like pneumonia or some other kind of infection,\u201d Ling said. \u201cYou come off [the drugs], and then people say, \u2018Why can\u2019t they just go back to their old self?\u2019 But they can\u2019t. Substance use has irreversible effects on the body and the brain.\u201d Some people need to stay on MAT for years or decades \u2014 and that\u2019s okay, Ling says.\n\nSome experts push this argument further, challenging the notion that being in recovery necessarily means getting off drugs altogether. \u201cMy goals for my patients are that they are alive, healthy, and able to have a connected, meaningful life,\u201d said Sue of Yale, who is the former medical director of the National Harm Reduction Coalition. \u201cI do not care how much or what they use in order to achieve that.\u201d For some people, that means strict sobriety; for others, it might mean using drugs less often, or using certain drugs but not others. Sue never mandates abstinence. \u201cThe first thing I always ask my patients is, \u2018What are your goals, in regards to your substance use?\u2019\u201d Sue told me. \u201cMost people have never been asked that question.\u201d\n\nProviders on the cutting edge of addiction treatment are increasingly moving toward this approach, with greater emphasis on harm reduction, an evidence-based, albeit controversial, strategy that aims to minimize the damaging effects of drug use rather than fixating on forcing patients to get \u201cclean.\u201d In a society raised on the concept of total abstinence from drugs, that can be a tough sell politically \u2014 but the idea is that opioid addiction is a serious illness, and breaking an addiction to opioids is extremely hard (as Ling said, patients can\u2019t simply go back to their old selves). Harm reduction is in part about finding an approach that will actually work for people: reaching those who might not otherwise seek care, empowering them to make their own choices, and helping them work toward incremental changes.\n\nHarm reduction measures include safe consumption sites (where people use drugs under the supervision of trained medical professionals), syringe exchange programs (where users can obtain clean needles), distribution programs for naloxone (a medication that can reverse an overdose), and fentanyl test strips (which can prevent overdoses by detecting whether someone\u2019s drugs contain fentanyl). \u201cAny positive change \u2014 that\u2019s sort of the mantra of harm reduction,\u201d said Sue.\n\nCutting-edge treatments don\u2019t mean much if patients can\u2019t access them\n\nA visit last fall with one of Sarah Wakeman\u2019s patients during a checkup in her Boston clinic gave me a glimpse of addiction treatment \u2014 and the barriers that work against it. Samuel (who\u2019s being referred to by a pseudonym to protect his privacy) first encountered opioids in high school, when his doctor prescribed them (\u201cpretty heavily,\u201d he said) for a wrestling injury. \u201cI found out that I liked it,\u201d he said, and he became addicted in college, after experimenting with drugs with a roommate. Before long, he wound up on heroin. For several years, his life unraveled: debt, lost jobs, defaulted loans, an arrest, multiple trips to rehab and 12-step programs.\n\nSamuel found his way to Wakeman\u2019s practice a few years ago. He\u2019s stable now, taking buprenorphine \u2014 with a job and an apartment and a new puppy. But he told me he\u2019d encountered judgment and distrust from many of the people he initially looked to for help, even those whose job it is to help him, like doctors and psychiatrists. Even now, pharmacists sometimes hesitate to refill his buprenorphine prescription, leading him to stash extra doses so he doesn\u2019t run out, he said, which can be \u201cdangerous behavior\u201d for someone with an addiction.\n\nThat stigma compounds the hurdles that are already a part of buprenorphine treatment. Although it\u2019s intended to be a long-term therapy, as a controlled substance, it is prescribed in small increments that must be refilled every few days or weeks. If he\u2019d been any less motivated to get better, he told me, he\u2019s not sure he would have made it \u2014 or, he added, if he\u2019d been any less privileged: Samuel is an educated white man in his mid-30s who grew up in a family of medical professionals.\n\nThe logistical and ideological obstacles to treatment are, of course, tied to the kinds of people who bear the brunt of the epidemic \u2014 those who exist, in one way or another, on the margins of society. Addiction is one of a cluster of interconnected crises unfolding across the country: homelessness, poverty, mental illness, untreated trauma, an epidemic of loneliness. Opioid overdoses spiked in 2020 during the onslaught of Covid-19, in part because people were isolated from each other as well as from treatment. Racism plays a major role in limiting access to treatment, too, as does mass incarceration. There\u2019s a shortage of addiction care providers, particularly in rural America, where the scarcity of basic primary care for all types of patients is increasingly dire.\n\nUntil recently, nearly 60 percent of rural people lived in counties without a single doctor authorized to prescribe buprenorphine. (That changed last year, after a law requiring providers to obtain a special waiver to dispense the medication was eliminated.) In Madison, Wisconsin, where Elizabeth Salisbury-Afshar practices addiction medicine, it\u2019s not unusual for patients to travel one or two hours each way to her clinic \u201cfor an appointment that\u2019s maybe 30 minutes long,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a full-day endeavor. But folks don\u2019t have another choice.\u201d\n\nIn rural areas, Salisbury-Ashfar said, many of the primary care doctors who would be the first line of addiction treatment are too overwhelmed to provide it. \u201cThe providers that we have, we\u2019re just trying not to burn them out, because we are short-staffed on every front,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would love to have enough primary care docs to be doing this, but primary care docs can\u2019t keep up with primary care.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to have a breakthrough treatment like MAT if the people who need it can\u2019t get it \u2014 or can\u2019t stay in it. Among the \u201ccompounding mistakes and failures\u201d that led to the current crisis is the fact that \u201cour health care system is not set up well to accommodate people who are vulnerable or marginalized,\u201d a group that includes most of those with addiction, said Joudrey, the Pittsburgh addiction doctor. \u201cIn the United States, we\u2019ve become so focused on innovation and looking for technological solutions, we can end up neglecting the sociological and economic contributors of the overdose epidemic.\u201d\n\nJoudrey told me about a patient he met years ago in a mobile treatment program. He started her on buprenorphine, which helped her stop using fentanyl, and every year afterward, she would send a thank-you email. \u201cShe was just thrilled,\u201d he recalled. But she was also socially isolated and stuck in a dead-end job that didn\u2019t quite pay the bills. This precarity left her at greater risk of falling back into drugs. \u201cThe medicine didn\u2019t change her larger social circumstances,\u201d Joudrey said. \u201cAs a clinician, as a researcher, it\u2019s sort of grappling with what we can and can\u2019t do, in terms of the limits of health care and medicine.\u201d\n\nWe have low-effort interventions that can make a difference\n\nThese experiences hammer home the urgent need to build a different treatment architecture to lower overdose deaths. Research has outlined a number of promising approaches. Some have begun gaining traction already, including harm reduction. Although contentious for many years because many believed it enabled drug use, harm reduction has been gaining mainstream acceptance among providers and policymakers. Decades of research, in the US as well as in countries like Canada and Ukraine, show that it saves both lives and money.\n\nDespite halting and uneven progress, a nationwide push to bring MAT into jails and prisons \u2014 driven in part by ACLU lawsuits in several states \u2014 is picking up momentum. The need for this is urgent: Overdose deaths from drugs or alcohol rose by 600 percent in state prisons between 2001 and 2018, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics \u2014 which estimated in 2009 (the most recent year with national data) that almost two-thirds of incarcerated people have substance use disorders. A 2015 study in North Carolina found that the risk of overdose was as much as 40 times higher for those recently released from prison than for other state residents.\n\nIn 2014, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where Wakeman practices, opened one of the first \u201cbridge clinics\u201d in the country, intended to bridge the gap between a patient\u2019s discharge from the emergency room (after, say, an overdose) and longer-term addiction treatment \u2014 a critical moment, Wakeman told me, when the risk of relapse or overdose is high. Patients can walk into the bridge clinic without an appointment \u2014 from the emergency department down the hall, or simply right off the street \u2014 and begin buprenorphine treatment that day. They can also receive psychiatric counseling services, recovery coaching, and nursing care, and the clinic keeps harm reduction supplies for patients still using. If they want to, Wakeman said, people can just have a cup of coffee and \u201chang out here if they need a place to be okay.\u201d\n\nBridge clinics have been opening up at other sites, too, including dozens in California alone, and early evidence shows they\u2019ve led to promising rates of MAT treatment and linked patients to longer-term addiction care. Those effects can ripple through other parts of the hospital. One study by researchers in Syracuse, New York, found that emergency department visits dropped by 42 percent in the six months after a bridge clinic opened. Research also indicates that bridge clinics help fill a void in care for patients with \u201cclinically complex\u201d cases: patients with concurrent addictions to other substances, serious mental illness, homelessness, and infections like HIV or hepatitis.\n\nWhere primary care doctors are stretched thin, nurses could fill gaps in access to care. Since 2016, federal regulations have allowed nurse practitioners and physician assistants (PAs) to prescribe buprenorphine, but laws in some states, including those hit hard by the overdose crisis, still block them from providing that care. Tennessee explicitly forbids nurses and PAs from prescribing buprenorphine. \u201cSo you can\u2019t do everything you\u2019re educated and certified to do,\u201d said Matthew Tierney, a psychiatric nurse practitioner and clinical professor at the University of California San Francisco, who serves as medical director for inpatient substance use management for UCSF Health. Advanced practice nurses, he said, especially those in mental health, \u201chave the education and training to really treat substance related disorders.\u201d When federal rules opened up prescribing to nurses and PAs, they began applying for licenses in higher numbers than physicians.\n\nBringing methadone care into normal medical settings, like in other countries, would be a huge step in opening up access. Early in the Covid pandemic, many methadone clinics relaxed their rules, allowing more take-home doses and letting family members pick up medications for patients in quarantine \u2014 offering a glimpse of what lasting change might look like.\n\nA bill before Congress, the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act (MOTA), would effectively make that permanent, authorizing addiction medicine physicians and psychiatrists to prescribe methadone. Studies indicate that patients are no more likely to overdose or abuse the medication when they\u2019re able to take home a longer supply. In fact, it seems to help survival rates.\n\nAmong addiction specialists, opinions about MOTA are, admittedly, not uniform \u2014 some worry the bill goes too far and would put patients at risk of methadone overdose, while others think it doesn\u2019t go far enough in expanding access. Rachel Simon, a doctor who practices at the methadone clinic in New York\u2019s Bellevue Hospital, sees MOTA as \u201ca crucial first step\u201d to lowering treatment barriers. \u201cMethadone is a beautiful medicine,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe time to make changes was yesterday.\u201d\n\nWhat if we remove treatment from sterile medical settings?\n\nFor some patients, it might help to disentangle addiction care from formal medical settings. Context matters, and making treatment more culturally authentic can succeed where other approaches fail. The Connecticut-based Imani Breakthrough Project, launched in 2017, brings addiction care into Black and Latinx churches as a way to address racial disparities in treatment. Developed by Yale addiction psychiatrists Ayana Jordan and Chyrell Bellamy, the program (\u201cImani\u201d means \u201cfaith\u201d in Swahili) consists of weekly mutual support and recovery education classes alongside individualized coaching and cognitive behavioral therapy, all held in churches.\n\n\u201cThis project was really born out of a dire need,\u201d Jordan told me \u2014 at a time when Black and Hispanic overdose deaths were climbing, but the media was primarily focused on the epidemic\u2019s white, rural victims.\n\nWhile they were developing the program, Jordan said, \u201coverwhelmingly, what we found is that people didn\u2019t want to come into traditional care. They didn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d (Black Americans in particular often distrust the medical establishment \u2014 with good historical reason.) And for many patients, spirituality was important to recovery, Jordan told me, so the church itself represented a form of intervention: a sacred and familiar space where people in the community felt known.\n\nOriginally located in eight churches across Connecticut, the program recently expanded into Rhode Island and New Orleans, with plans to open in Boston and New York City. In 2021, Jordan and her team launched a new version of the Imani program as a five-year NIH-funded project, in which participants can consult with Black or Latinx psychiatrists via telehealth to start MAT in their church. The eventual goal, she told me, is to implement the Imani model nationwide.\n\nAccording to a study of Imani\u2019s first three years, a striking 42 percent of participants remained in the program after 12 weeks. (There isn\u2019t a perfect comparison to treatment in a standard medical setting, but a 2016 analysis of addiction treatment data found that 20 percent of Black patients and 15 percent of Latinx patients completed their programs, compared to 60 percent of white patients.) Participants also improved their scores on tests measuring wellness and community citizenship. \u201cAnd we had great outcomes in terms of stopping substance use altogether, or decreasing their substance use,\u201d Jordan told me.\n\nRecalling the early sessions, Jordan said, \u201cWe were seeing for the first time an environment that is really clear about the sovereignty of being Black or Latinx.\u201d In a country where the dual identity of being a person of color with addiction means that \u201cyou\u2019re totally thrown away,\u201d she said, having a place where \u201cchurch members alongside people who look like you, welcome you, and also integrate medical practices into the group is extremely powerful.\u201d",

        "text": "\u2018You only need two sentences to understand British politics,\u201d Lord Maurice Saatchi told a recent News Agents podcast. \u201cConservatives are efficient but cruel. Labour is caring but incompetent.\u201d Now, though, as the election approaches: \u201cYou have the Conservatives as inefficient but cruel, and that\u2019s going to be a complete disaster.\u201d\n\nLots of analysis echoes Saatchi\u2019s observation \u2013 that these surprising bedfellows, cruelty and inefficiency, have come together only lately, in the dying days of the Conservative party, explaining the magnitude of its coming fall. The Rwanda policy is often cited here. Or the idea of forcing young people to spend weekends doing community service, at great public expense.\n\nBut beneath these comments is, I think, an unexamined premise: that the combination is unusual \u2013 that ordinarily policies may be harsh, or inept, but are rarely both at once. This assumption is baked into common phrases in our politics \u2013 \u201ctough measures\u201d, \u201ccrackdowns\u201d, \u201charsh truths\u201d \u2013 suggesting a natural rule: you take the ruthless course because it is the most expedient.\n\nBut the premise isn\u2019t right. Cruelty and competence do not, in fact, tend always to go together. Instead, the rule seems to run the other way. The Rwanda policy is just one example among many. The more brutal the policy, the less effective it often seems to be.\n\nExamples are scattered across society. Cutting benefits to the bone does not motivate people into work, but tends to block them out of it, as barriers such as childcare and debt become too large to surmount. Harsher sentencing can lead to more crime, not less: reoffending rates go up when people are sent to prison rather than punished in the community. Stinginess with healthcare leads to an unhealthy population that cannot work at its potential. Fail to deal with homelessness, and you\u2019ll have to keep people in expensive emergency housing.\n\nThe truth that has not yet been grasped: if you break people beyond a certain point, you\u2019ll probably end up having to support them. Past a threshold level of deprivation \u2013 if you are ill, grindingly poor, in a loop that shuffles you in and out of prison \u2013 you do not respond to carrots and sticks like the rest of us. Threats don\u2019t work. You can\u2019t just snap out of it. When it comes to policy, real cruelty is \u2013 perhaps we could say in essence \u2013 inefficient.\n\nIf there\u2019s a particular parable for this, it is in a coming disaster that few have yet started to grapple with, or even acknowledge. Britain is on the brink of a drugs crisis for which decades of punitive policies have left it singularly unprepared. When it really takes hold, our approach will be exactly the wrong way round. Drug addicts cannot be chivvied into sobriety with threats and penalties \u2013 addiction doesn\u2019t work like that. But, trapped by social stigma, that is what we will try to do. We will be cruel and inefficient.\n\nWhy is this happening now? A boom in synthetic opioids, which are cheap to make and get round pesky things such as crop failure. They may be 50 times stronger than heroin, but are often taken inadvertently when they are used to pack out more expensive stuff. They show up in everything from off-brand painkiller pills to cannabis products to heroin itself. The rate of drug deaths in England and Wales rose 82% between 2012 and 2022, the most recent year for which the Office for National Statistics has data. And things are about to get worse. In 2021, the Taliban announced a ban on opium poppy cultivation, producing a large gap in the market. Synthetic drugs will fill it.\n\nBut as this disaster approaches, the UK\u2019s severe, moralistic approach to drugs \u2013 once declared as a war \u2013 is blocking all the escape routes. It is one of the few places in Europe, for example, without overdose prevention centres, in which people can take their own drugs in the presence of healthcare workers and treatments. Drug users in the UK are 13 times more likely to die than their European counterparts. These rooms are cheap to run, and points at which addicts can be directed into treatment. But they are resisted \u2013 although one is due in Scotland. Rishi Sunak has said they \u201ccondone use of drugs\u201d.\n\nDrug-checking services are crucial, too. The UK\u2019s first, the Loop in Bristol, was licensed only this year. Such a service might have prevented the death of 16-year-old David Celino, who died after taking ecstasy in 2022. But the Loop had been fighting government reluctance for years. There should be many more like it.\n\nThen there is safe supply, for example through doctors. This tends to be rejected on principle: why should the public pay for a junkie\u2019s free heroin? But it\u2019s cheaper by far than the alternative. With safe supply, crime drops, overdoses fall and people get their lives back together and enter treatment. Keeping addicts in prison, on benefits, in and out of emergency rooms or shuffling through the courts is far costlier in the end. Those who inject drugs are vulnerable to long-term illnesses such as hepatitis C. That, too, is expensive to treat.\n\nBut the UK has a sort of mental block when it comes to drugs, and what actually works to solve the problem. Harsh policies are inefficient, but that is something we don\u2019t want to hear. Instead, this March, we greeted signs of trouble with stern rhetoric and revival of \u201ctough on drugs\u201d policies \u2013 making 15 synthetic drugs class A, possession of which can get you seven years in prison.\n\nIt\u2019s a mental block we need to get over. The urge to punish drug addicts doesn\u2019t make them go away. It just entrenches them in their misery, dependent on state provision, unable even to begin to help themselves. Might a new government take a more caring approach? It is the most efficient way.",

            "Lev Facher"
        ],
        "text": "The opioid overdose epidemic has burned through the U.S. for nearly 30 years. Yet for all that time, the country has had tools that are highly effective at preventing overdose deaths: methadone and buprenorphine.\n\nThese medicines are cheap and easy to distribute. People who take them use illicit drugs at far lower rates, and are at far lower risk of overdose or death. By beating back the cravings and agonizing withdrawal symptoms that result from trying to quit opioids \u201ccold turkey,\u201d methadone and buprenorphine can help people addicted to opioids escape an existence defined by drugs and achieve stable, healthy lives.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut a yearlong investigation by STAT shows that virtually every sector of American society is obstructing the use of medications that could prevent tens of thousands of deaths each year. Increasingly, public health experts and even government officials cast the country\u2019s singular failure to prevent overdose deaths not as an unavoidable tragedy but as a conscious choice.\n\nNarcotics Anonymous, a nationwide organization that promotes the 12-step model of addiction recovery, actively opposes the use of medication, leading would-be participants like Mark Palinski, 38, to be banned from chapter meetings in North Carolina after disclosing that he had been prescribed buprenorphine. Hundreds of jails and prisons bar their use even when prescribed by a doctor, forcing people like Amanda Cassidy-Trejo, 41, to suffer weeks of agonizing withdrawal in a San Antonio jail cell. Even specialized methadone clinics, which otherwise support the use of medications, can make them all but impossible to access, requiring patients like Rebecca Smith, 65, to show up daily at her Detroit clinic to swallow a single dose \u2014 a rule that forced her to quit her job.\n\nFew doctors prescribe buprenorphine (commonly known by the brand name Suboxone). Roughly 40% of Walmart, Rite Aid, and CVS pharmacy locations decline to stock it. Many rehab facilities and sober living houses refuse to admit people taking either medication. Federal regulations often prevent truck drivers and pilots from taking methadone or buprenorphine. In many cases, state medical boards even prevent doctors and nurses in recovery from taking the same medications they\u2019d provide to patients seeking treatment for opioid addiction.\n\nThough overdose death rates have climbed steadily for the past two decades, researchers estimate that barely one-fifth of the approximately 2.5 million Americans with opioid use disorder receive medication \u2014 and tens of thousands have died for lack of it.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cMore than 80,000 people are dying of opioid overdose every year, and yet we have a tool, medication-assisted treatment, that we know dramatically reduces overdose deaths,\u201d said David Frank, a medical sociologist at New York University who takes methadone for opioid addiction. \u201cBut because it\u2019s so difficult to access, people that could and should be alive continue to die.\u201d\n\nSTAT\u2019s examination of the overdose epidemic is based on hundreds of interviews with patients, doctors, policy experts, lawmakers, scientists, and other major figures in drug policy and addiction medicine. It relies on an exhaustive review of legal documents, tax filings, financial disclosures, patient records, lobbying reports, and peer-reviewed academic research. And it includes a first-of-its-kind analysis of the ownership and practices of America\u2019s roughly 2,000 methadone clinics, detailing for the first time how private equity firms have acquired a major stake in the nation\u2019s addiction-treatment infrastructure while opposing calls for reform.\n\nMethadone and buprenorphine have one major drawback: They are themselves opioids, a fact that opponents have used to cast the medications as no better than illicit drugs sold on a street corner. Indeed, they are not perfect: Methadone, which is sometimes used to treat pain, can cause sedation or even overdose if used improperly. Buprenorphine, while far safer, can also cause complications when used in combination with alcohol or other drugs. Amid a broad push to increase access to addiction medications, some experts have argued for proceeding with caution.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue to improve access, but we need to do it in a way that maintains quality and safety,\u201d said Kenneth Stoller, an addiction psychiatrist and researcher at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIf we\u2019re expanding access by just flooding the streets with a medication that we know is easily misused, and when misused is dangerous, that\u2019s a problem as well.\u201d\n\nBut both medications are far less potent than the illicit substances whose use they are meant to prevent, like heroin or fentanyl. And they are the gold standard for addiction treatment.\n\nIn an interview, Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, estimated that if methadone and buprenorphine were made universally available nationwide, opioid overdoses would fall by half, if not more.\n\n\u201cWe have these very effective medications, and the question is why are they not being implemented,\u201d she said. \u201cI estimate that we would have at least 50% less people dying, and that\u2019s conservative. I think it would probably be much more consequential.\u201d\n\nYet instead of providing people with pharmaceuticals known to treat their condition, in the United States, common approaches to treating opioid addiction still include undergoing painful and ineffective \u201cdetox\u201d; 12-step approaches like Narcotics Anonymous; or even \u201cequine therapy,\u201d a form of treatment that centers on spending time with horses.\n\nWhile such programs often rely heavily on hope, mindfulness, and religion, they often ignore the physiological realities of addiction \u2014 in particular, the debilitating withdrawal that occurs when regular opioid users attempt to suddenly stop. In any other medical field, favoring prayer over proven medication would be considered malpractice. Yet for addiction treatment in the U.S., it\u2019s simply the way things work.\n\n\u201cThere is a core belief, that\u2019s different from other countries, that people with opioid addiction don\u2019t deserve care in the way that somebody who has cancer or diabetes does,\u201d said Ayana Jordan, a researcher and addiction psychiatrist at NYU Langone Health. \u201cPeople genuinely have no idea how effective these medications are at preventing people from dying.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not changing one drug for another\u2019\n\nThe evidence supporting the use of methadone and buprenorphine is overwhelming. According to NIDA, patients using methadone and buprenorphine are 59% and 38% less likely, respectively, to die of an opioid overdose compared to those not receiving medication. Other data show an even greater effect: One recent study demonstrated an overall 80% drop in opioid overdose deaths among people taking either medication. A separate study showed that incarcerated people taking methadone or buprenorphine were 80% less likely to die of overdose in the first month after being released. The World Health Organization lists both medications on its model list of essential medicines, citing a \u201cstrong evidence base for their use.\u201d\n\nThe medications have remarkable secondary effects, too. People being treated with methadone or buprenorphine are vastly less likely to be diagnosed with HIV, hepatitis C, endocarditis, and other diseases that can be transmitted via drug injection. Both medications are also associated with a marked decrease in depression symptoms.\n\nWhile methadone and buprenorphine are opioids, they bear little resemblance to the substances that cause the vast majority of opioid overdoses \u2014 namely heroin and fentanyl. Methadone is extremely slow-acting, making it a poor option for people seeking opioids\u2019 euphoric effects. Buprenorphine is known as a partial agonist, meaning it only partly binds to the receptor that provides a \u201chigh\u201d when stimulated by other opioids. Practically speaking, buprenorphine only has one true use: treating opioid addiction.\n\nA third medication, Vivitrol, has been embraced as a treatment for opioid addiction by many judges, prisons, and some doctors specifically because, though it reduces opioid cravings, it is not an opioid. A recent analysis shows that people who take Vivitrol \u2014 which costs as much as $2,100 per monthly dose \u2014 may in fact overdose at higher rates than people taking buprenorphine.\n\nDespite the medications\u2019 remarkable effectiveness, the country\u2019s view of buprenorphine and methadone is built largely on myths and stigma. In 2017, Tom Price, then health secretary to President Trump, referred to what is called medication-assisted treatment as \u201cjust substituting one opioid for another.\u201d Law enforcement agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, while widely criticized for allowing the proliferation of OxyContin and other painkillers that fueled the opioid epidemic in the 1990s and 2000s, now forcefully regulate buprenorphine and methadone, even as illicit fentanyl floods the market.\n\n\u201cThey are not changing one drug for another,\u201d said Volkow, who has led the federal government\u2019s $1.6 billion addiction research institute since 2003. \u201cThey\u2019re not different from other medications you may need to take, like antihypertensive medications or antidiabetic medications. They allow for your physiology to be normalized, which is necessary to achieve recovery.\u201d\n\nStill, in much of the U.S., the prevailing attitude remains that achieving sobriety by using medications does not constitute true recovery. Even \u201cmedication-assisted treatment,\u201d long a common term in the field, betrays an embedded stigma: That the medication itself is not a treatment, but a supplement. Many addiction doctors now prefer a new term: medications for opioid use disorder.\n\nIn many people\u2019s minds, the only route to beating opioid addiction is to simply stop using, experience days or weeks of agonizing withdrawal, and never use opioids again \u2014 even if those opioids are highly regulated medications prescribed for the purpose of treating addiction. Doctors, however, say the approach fails for nearly everyone who tries it, especially in the age of highly potent illicit fentanyl.\n\n\u201cThe people that come to me to seek treatment with medication have basically all tried to stop using without medication,\u201d said Zoe Weinstein, a doctor who serves as the director of Boston Medical Center\u2019s addiction consult service and medical director of a methadone clinic. \u201cThere are a lot of people who need medication, and many more people who want medication than are able to access it.\u201d\n\n\u2018That\u2019s how nuts this is\u2019\n\nThe U.S. laws and practices governing addiction medicine are not just out of step with the latest science \u2014 they are also out of step with laws in most of the Western world.\n\nAt Arud, a substance use clinic in Zurich, Switzerland, patients receiving addiction medications are free to come and go as they please. They pick up weeks\u2019 worth of methadone, and other powerful addiction drugs, at a pharmacy, and are not forced to undergo drug testing or regular counseling sessions as a condition of receiving their medication. While American law enforcement officials and methadone industry representatives have warned that easier access could increase methadone misuse and even overdose, Switzerland\u2019s results have been the opposite. There, and throughout Western and Central Europe, countries that have increased addiction medications\u2019 availability have consistently seen overdose deaths and infectious disease transmission plummet to rates vastly lower than in the United States.\n\n\u201cWe have a precedent in France,\u201d said Volkow, the NIDA director. \u201cWhat the French did was basically provide buprenorphine to every single person that needed it. And you see this dramatic reduction in overdoses \u2014 they basically stopped.\u201d\n\nFor decades, American physicians needed to obtain a special license known as the \u201cX-waiver\u201d just to prescribe buprenorphine. As of 2021, just 75,000 of the nation\u2019s roughly 1.1 million physicians had obtained the waiver. The Biden administration effectively eliminated that requirement in early 2021, but according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the overall buprenorphine prescribing rate nonetheless decreased from 2021 to 2022.\n\nMethadone, which is widely accessible across Europe, is available in the U.S. only at specialized clinics known as opioid treatment programs, or OTPs. These clinics typically require patients to report in person each day to receive a single dose, forcing them to structure their lives around the clinic\u2019s dosing schedule.\n\n\u201cThis is practically the only medication in the entire country that is treated this way,\u201d said Rep. Don Norcross (D-N.J.), who has co-authored legislation that would allow specialized addiction doctors to prescribe methadone directly to patients. \u201cThe medication for abortion \u2014 that is easier accessed than methadone. That\u2019s how nuts this is. The idea that the only way to do this is to go to the methadone clinic is just insane.\u201d\n\nThe difficulty of accessing addiction medications, and the stigma that many Americans still attach to them, have deadly consequences. Studies consistently show that patients who do not take medication return to illegal drugs, overdose, or die at far higher rates than patients who do. Research also shows that as many as 90% of patients who participate in \u201cabstinence-based\u201d addiction treatment that bans the use of methadone or buprenorphine return to use within one year of being discharged. Treatment that relies on quitting opioids cold turkey, studies show, is significantly more dangerous than not receiving treatment at all.\n\nSystemically denying Americans access to addiction medications has also exacerbated racial health disparities. The first decades of the opioid crisis claimed far more white lives than Black lives. But as of 2022, the trend has flipped: Black people now die of opioid overdoses at higher rates \u2014 in part because Black people seeking treatment for opioid use disorder are far less likely than white people to be prescribed an addiction medication.\n\nThe cost of these outdated and scientifically inaccurate attitudes is immense. The opioid crisis has shortened the national life expectancy by more than half a year, weakened U.S. economic output by $1.5 trillion in 2020 alone, and ruined the lives of countless others who are addicted to heroin or fentanyl but haven\u2019t died of an overdose.\n\nBut these medications are not a silver bullet: Even if methadone and buprenorphine were universally accessible, the opioid crisis wouldn\u2019t instantly end. Studies show that most Americans with opioid use disorder are not actively seeking treatment.\n\n\u2018The system creates barriers to care\u2019\n\nParadoxically, it is often those who claim to be most sympathetic to the cause of addiction treatment who are among the biggest opponents of expanded access to methadone and buprenorphine.\n\nThe recovery group Narcotics Anonymous \u2014 perhaps the country\u2019s largest provider of addiction treatment \u2014 has taken a hard line against addiction medication. The organization\u2019s own literature acknowledges that people taking methadone or buprenorphine are often banned from speaking at meetings, but offers a concession: \u201cNA may be compatible for addicts on medically assisted protocols if they have a desire to become clean one day.\u201d\n\nIn other words: In the view of Narcotics Anonymous, even people who have relied on methadone or buprenorphine to achieve stable recovery are not considered \u201cclean.\u201d Instead, their full participation in the program would require a pledge to stop taking medications they were prescribed by a doctor, and that first helped them quit illicit drugs.\n\nNarcotics Anonymous did not respond to STAT\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nMethadone clinics have also opposed calls to expanded access to medication treatment. The American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, a trade group representing methadone clinics, has lobbied not just against the deregulation of methadone treatment, but also against a bill that passed in 2022 with overwhelming bipartisan support that made it easier for doctors to prescribe buprenorphine. And in recent decades, methadone treatment has become big business: A majority of methadone clinics now operate as for-profits, and nearly one-third are owned by private equity firms. As calls for reform have grown far louder in recent years, the methadone industry has guarded its monopoly fiercely, and remains staunchly opposed to allowing other doctors to prescribe the medication to patients in need.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSign up for Daily Recap\n\nAll the health and medical news you need today, in one email\n\nPlease enter a valid email address.\n\nSeparately, according to federal survey data, at least 751 substance use treatment facilities offer treatment for opioid addiction but reject clients using methadone and buprenorphine. More than 2,000 addiction treatment facilities did not respond to the federal survey, meaning the true number of facilities banning medication is probably significantly higher.\n\nMany medical schools still don\u2019t require any training in addiction medicine, or prescribing addiction medications. Many hospitals still do not offer patients buprenorphine or methadone, even in the immediate aftermath of an overdose. Many pharmacies choose not to stock buprenorphine. And insurers, in an effort to pad profit margins, sometimes refuse to pay for newly developed injectable buprenorphine formulations, which last weeks or months and are shown to help patients remain in treatment \u2014 but cost far more than cheaper versions that must be taken daily.\n\nThe American criminal justice system also remains skeptical of medication as treatment. The Drug Enforcement Administration has long displayed hostility to buprenorphine and methadone, and many jails and prisons refuse altogether to provide incarcerated people with either medication. Many judges with no medical training \u2014 even in \u201cdrug court\u201d systems supposedly meant to aid addiction recovery \u2014 have historically barred people arrested for low-grade drug offenses from taking any opioid, including addiction medications.\n\nAs workers, people taking addiction medications face immense discrimination. Many employers, labor unions, and professional societies ban their members from taking addiction medications in any circumstance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of ways that the system creates barriers to care,\u201d said Weinstein, the Boston addiction doctor. \u201cWe start to believe that if the system is created that way, it must be necessary, there must be a good reason. But that may not be true: The reason may be outdated, or never existed, or was based on stigma.\u201d\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t get you high\u2019\n\nThe addiction crisis is among the largest public health emergencies in U.S. history. But the American people and government have treated it with a remarkable lack of urgency.\n\nRecent events provide a stark comparison. In early 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic led the U.S. to launch an unprecedented effort to develop a vaccine. The government told drug companies, in essence, that it would pay them whatever they wanted. Most doctors made clear that they would provide any eventual vaccines to anybody who wanted them.\n\nThe U.S. opioid crisis is precisely the opposite. More than 1 million Americans have died of drug overdoses since 2000, and opioid death rates have steadily increased for the past two decades. But there is no Operation Warp Speed for addiction. There has been no rush to develop miraculous new drugs that can sharply reduce deaths from a devastating health crisis \u2014 in part because the government and pharmaceutical industry have displayed minimal interest in the crisis, and in part because these medications already exist.\n\nThe public\u2019s broad opposition to addiction medications stands in stark contrast to its general acceptance of other common strategies used to improve health. Broadly speaking, Americans do not oppose drinking Diet Coke instead of Coke, cooking with olive oil instead of butter, or chewing nicotine gum instead of smoking cigarettes. But when it comes to using relatively weak, highly regulated, pharmaceutical-grade opioids to help quit deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl, much of society remains staunchly opposed.\n\nThe entertainment industry, in particular, has often served as a cheerleader for misleading tropes and treatment approaches that oppose medication. The recent hit show \u201cEuphoria,\u201d for instance, depicts a teen who develops an opioid addiction but is only offered treatment based on the 12-step model offered by Narcotics Anonymous \u2014 not with medication. A decade ago, \u201cHouse,\u201d an award-winning medical drama about the star doctor at an elite teaching hospital, gave its protagonist two choices: use copious amounts of Vicodin or grit out a week of brutal and dangerous withdrawal. \u201cFour Good Days,\u201d a Mila Kunis movie released in 2020, is based on a nearly identical premise.\n\nThe few mainstream voices who have sought to increase acceptance for medications have failed \u2014 often in tragic fashion. Kurt Cobain, among the most influential musicians of his generation, wrote in a 1993 journal entry that he had found success treating his opioid withdrawal symptoms thanks to buprenorphine.\n\n\u201cThe best thing about it is that there are no known side effects,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt acts as an opiate but it doesn\u2019t get you high.\u201d\n\nThe doctor who prescribed buprenorphine to Cobain died in 1993, however, cutting him off from a medication that, at the time, was only legally available as a pain treatment. Unable to find another doctor willing to provide it, he returned to heroin use. He died by suicide in 1994.\n\n\u2018We need everybody to step up\u2019\n\nAttitudes toward medication for opioid use disorder are finally beginning to shift. The 2022 repeal of the X-waiver requirement for doctors came after years of lobbying from public health groups seeking wider access to buprenorphine.\n\nIncreasingly, researchers and members of Congress have called for ending methadone clinics\u2019 monopoly and allowing physicians to prescribe the medication directly to patients. In 2021, the Urban Survivors Union, an activist group focused on harm reduction and the safety of people who use drugs, published the \u201cMethadone Manifesto,\u201d a sweeping call for change highlighting the human costs of the current methadone-distribution system.\n\nAnd for the first time, the White House has pledged to make medication access a priority: President Biden said in the 2022 State of the Union address that his administration plans to make addiction medications \u201cuniversally accessible\u201d by 2025.\n\nBut there is no chance the country will meet his goal.\n\nTo do so, far more doctors would need to prescribe buprenorphine. Hospitals, pharmacies, and insurers would need to radically shift their policy and practice to encourage the use of addiction medications and provide a less hostile treatment environment for people with addiction. Congress and local lawmakers would need to pass laws mandating access to medication treatment. Branches of government including prisons, courts, and law enforcement would need to overhaul their own rules regarding access to treatment for the hundreds of thousands of people with addiction charged with, or serving time for, drug-related crimes.\n\nKey components of the country\u2019s existing addiction treatment infrastructure, from Narcotics Anonymous to rehab facilities, would need to adopt a different tone regarding the benefits of methadone or buprenorphine. Many methadone clinics, as well, would need to take a more welcoming, less punitive tack toward patients who come to seek treatment.\n\nAbsent those changes, American society\u2019s deeply embedded bias against addiction medications make it all but certain that the status quo will remain \u2014 or at least, that the U.S. won\u2019t change course before losing hundreds of thousands more of its citizens.\n\n\u201cOutdated views, combined with stigma around treatments for opioid use disorder, combined with the challenging regulatory environment, are leading to a situation where people just aren\u2019t getting evidence-based care,\u201d said Jesse Ehrenfeld, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Medical Association. \u201cThis is a moment where we need everybody to step up, and stop dragging their feet.\u201d\n\nSTAT\u2019s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

        "title": "State Approaches to Addressing the Opioid Epidemic: Findings from a Survey of State Medicaid Programs",
        "authors": [
            "Heather Saunders",
            "Kathy Gifford Published:"
        ],
        "text": "Opioid overdoses rose to 81,051 in 2022, a slight increase from 80,411 in 2021, but a substantial 63% jump from 2019 (49,860). The sharp rise in recent years is mainly due to fentanyl, as the illicit supply of this drug has risen substantially. Notably, rises in overdose deaths have been particularly sharp among people of color and young people. Adding to these data, recent KFF polling shows that 29% of adults say either they or a family member have experienced an opioid addiction. Three medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are FDA approved: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Under the SUPPORT Act (major legislation passed in 2018 to address the opioid epidemic) these medications must be covered by Medicaid through 2025. Many provisions of the SUPPORT Act expired in September 2023 and Congress continues to debate legislation to reauthorize some expiring provisions and adopt new policies to address the opioid epidemic. There are a variety of efforts at the state level to address the epidemic. State Medicaid programs play a particular role in the opioid epidemic, covering nearly 40% of people with opioid use disorder (OUD).\n\nTo better understand how states are using Medicaid to help address the opioid epidemic, the 23rd annual Medicaid budget survey, conducted by KFF and Health Management Associates (HMA) asked about the following specific strategies adopted or planned by state Medicaid officials for state fiscal years (SFYs) 2023 and 2024 to address the opioid epidemic: removing prior authorization for buprenorphine (a medication treatment for OUD), reimbursing for the initiation of buprenorphine treatment via telehealth, covering over-the-counter (OTC) Narcan, and implementing other initiatives. Key takeaways include:\n\nMost states have removed prior authorization requirements for certain buprenorphine treatments, but other barriers remain and are complicated by the fentanyl epidemic. Prior authorization requirements for standard buprenorphine treatment have decreased substantially in recent years, but other hurdles, such as counseling mandates or prior authorization requirements for higher doses\u2014potentially necessary for treating people who used fentanyl\u2014still remain.\n\nMost Medicaid programs cover buprenorphine induction via telehealth, but this policy is dependent on evolving federal regulations. Over three-quarters of states provide fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement for buprenorphine induction over telehealth, but the future of this policy is subject to evolving federal regulations on prescribing controlled substances via telehealth.\n\nAt least one-third of states have or plan to add OTC Narcan to FFS Medicaid OTC formularies. One-third of states commented on plans or actions to add over the counter Narcan to their state\u2019s FFS formularies. Increased accessibility may also be impacted by effective Medicaid communication about OTC reimbursement policies and procedures.\n\nA number of states are pursuing options to add pre-release Medicaid coverage for incarcerated populations. At the time of the survey, two states secured CMS approval to provide Medicaid coverage to incarcerated individuals before release, including OUD treatment. As of January 2024, two states (California and Washington) have obtained CMS approval, and 15 other states have waivers pending.\n\nOpioid Use Disorder Treatment without Prior Authorization\n\nMedicaid programs must cover medications to treat OUD, like buprenorphine and methadone, but the actual access to these medications may vary for a variety of reasons, including utilization management strategies such as prior authorization (PA) that vary across Medicaid FFS programs and managed care organizations (MCO). In states without PA, patients may have longer buprenorphine treatment episodes, and Medicare data suggests that removing PA can reduce hospital and emergency department use. Although a number of states have enacted laws prohibiting PA for medications to treat OUD, many have not, leaving PA policy decisions up to the state Medicaid programs and sometimes their contracted health plans.\n\nAs of SFY 2024, most states no longer require prior authorization for at least one standard formulation of buprenorphine medication therapy under fee-for-service (FFS), reflecting a policy shift in recent years. As of SFY 2024, nearly all states cover at least one standard formulation and dosage of oral buprenorphine, such as buprenorphine-naloxone, without PA (Figure 1). Just a few years ago, in 2018, MACPAC reported that 30 states required PA for buprenorphine-naloxone, but as of SFY 2024, only a small number of Medicaid programs still have that requirement for at least one standard formulation or dosage. Many states impose PA requirements on non-standard forms of buprenorphine, such as higher doses or buprenorphine monotherapy, and PA requirements may vary across Medicaid managed care organizations within a state. Categorizing prior authorization policy is complex due to rapidly evolving policies and differences in prior authorization requirements that can vary across dosing, formulations, and populations.\n\nEven though most states removed prior authorization requirements for certain buprenorphine treatments, enrollees may still encounter ongoing and emerging barriers, including policies that have not yet adapted to the spread of the more potent fentanyl. While many states removed prior authorization for specific buprenorphine formulations, they often maintain prior authorization for higher doses. Yet, some physicians report that higher dosing may be necessary for patients with a history of fentanyl use, and research shows that higher dosing has implications for treatment retention. Beyond prior authorization policies, some states impose other criteria such as urine screening requirements, quantity limits, and counseling mandates\u2014additional restrictions that may impact access to or retention in care. Provider reimbursement rates may also play a role in attracting workforce to provide services.\n\nCoverage of Buprenorphine Treatment Initiation via Telehealth\n\nDuring the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) temporarily relaxed federal regulations to allow patients to start buprenorphine treatment for OUD via telehealth, eliminating the initial in-person visit requirement. This change boosted access and retention in care without increasing buprenorphine-related overdoses, and may have also helped to mitigate workforce shortages. While most states expanded telehealth coverage for behavioral health services in both FFS and managed care programs during the PHE, the extent of telehealth coverage for buprenorphine treatment varies by state, as Medicaid programs individually set their telehealth policies, as long as they are aligned with federal and state policy. Recently, the DEA, jointly with the Department of Health and Human Services, authorized a second temporary extension of COVID-19 telemedicine flexibilities, which continues the pandemic-era policies that allow controlled substance prescribing without an initial in-person visit through the end of 2024.\n\nOver three-quarters of states reported covering buprenorphine induction via telehealth under fee-for-service in SFY 2023. However, six states did not allow this coverage, and one state reported plans to discontinue coverage. The continuation of this policy is dependent on federal regulations pertaining to telehealth and prescribing of controlled substances. During the pandemic, federal regulations were relaxed to facilitate treatment access, allowing buprenorphine to be prescribed via telehealth without an in-person visit\u2013a temporary measure set to expire on December 31st 2024. However, state policies can still mandate in-person visits, potentially complicating treatment access in those states.\n\nCoverage of Over-the-Counter Narcan\n\nNaloxone, commonly known as Narcan, a life-saving medication that can reverse opioid overdoses, is now available over the counter as a nasal spray. While the FDA has approved two versions of OTC Narcan, only one is currently available in pharmacies. Its price tag, roughly $45 for a 2-dose, 4mg nasal spray, may be unaffordable for many who lack OTC insurance coverage including Medicaid enrollees in states that have not added OTC Narcan to their Medicaid OTC formularies and/or required their MCOs to do so. To obtain federal matching funds, federal Medicaid law also requires Medicaid enrollees to obtain a prescription for covered OTC products \u2013 another hurdle that may impede access. The most recent KFF budget survey asked states about their strategies to enhance enrollee access to OTC Narcan and many states offered comments regarding their coverage or planned coverage of OTC Narcan.\n\nAbout one-third of states reported that they had added or planned to add OTC Narcan to their state\u2019s OTC formularies. This is likely an undercount of states currently covering OTC Narcan as not all states chose to specifically comment on their Medicaid coverage policy. In addition to adding OTC Narcan to their formularies, Massachusetts commented that Narcan is exempt from Medicaid copay requirements and California mentioned the state\u2019s Naloxone Distribution Project ships free naloxone directly to eligible entities such as law enforcement, schools, community organizations, and city, county, and Tribal organizations. Other states mentioned standing order policies or other initiatives that make it easier for pharmacists to dispense Narcan. Although these policies might make it easier for enrollees to access OTC Narcan, factors such as clear enrollee communication about the reimbursement for OTC Narcan, where Narcan is placed in stores, and Narcan access for family members may also play a role in its overall accessibility.\n\nOther State Initiatives\n\nStates were asked about other Medicaid initiatives to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe most frequently mentioned initiative was the pursuit of Section 1115 Demonstration Waiver authority to cover OUD services for inmates prior to release. At the time of the survey, two states obtained CMS approval (California and Washington) and 14 states had waiver requests under review for these demonstration projects under section 1115, which permits Medicaid programs to provide services before inmate release (including OUD treatment). As of January 2024, two states have approvals and an additional 15 states have re-entry waiver requests under CMS review. Following release from prison, individuals face a significantly higher risk of overdose and death, primarily from opioids, with a study in one state showing a 40 times greater risk of opioid overdose in the first two weeks after release compared to the general public. In states that expanded Medicaid, most individuals recently released from prison meet income and eligibility requirements for Medicaid coverage, but the Medicaid Inmate Exclusion Policy under federal Medicaid law prohibits federal dollars from paying for health care services of inmates in most cases. CMS guidance requires that states seeking pre-release waivers must cover medication-assisted treatment, but other details vary.\n\nStates reported other initiatives; some that are specific to Medicaid and others that are broader:\n\nExpanding access to services by removing copays, expanding provider types, or adjusting reimbursement. For example, Maryland added coverage of peer recovery support services for SUD services provided at specific locations and Indiana began to reimburse Opioid Treatment Programs using a weekly bundled rate, rather than a per diem rate. More broadly, Medicaid programs are continuing to broaden coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. In FY 2023 and 2024, more than a third of states reported benefit enhancements or additions and about three-quarters of states reported increases or plans to increase, the fee-for-service payment rates for at least one type of behavioral health provider.\n\nInnovative programs or solutions. Some states are testing out new delivery methods or innovative programs. For example, Delaware submitted a waiver amendment to allow coverage for contingency management Texas is continuing to provide services under the Maternal Opioid Misuse (MOM) model to provide treatment services to pregnant women with OUD. Often, state efforts involve collaborations that span across several state agencies. For example, Arizona is working to expand access to mobile opioid treatment programs to bring treatment to those in underserved areas and is partnering with other state agencies to coordinate an opioid response plan. Vermont has a longstanding approach, Hub and Spoke model, to address OUD that spans multiple agencies.\n\nAlternative opioid treatment or safe opioid prescribing. Other states are working to reduce reliance on prescriptions opioids. For example, Idaho and Alaska reported focusing on safe opioid prescribing policies and Pennsylvania reported revising prior authorization guidelines for opioid prescriptions. Missouri\u2019s health plans offer a program intended to help provide alternatives to opioids for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nDespite recent increased access to OUD treatment, a notable treatment gap remains as one-third of diagnosed Medicaid enrollees are not receiving treatment. This issue is particularly acute among Black people, youth, and those with disabilities, where substantial disparities in access to MOUD persist. Behavioral health workforce shortages, prevalent across the continuum of behavioral health services and provider types, are also present in Medicaid\u2013 along with a lack of provider diversity and few culturally competent care options. Medicaid programs in many states are addressing these challenges by implementing strategies to address workforce shortages and by using managed care contracts to address and reduce disparities, with some efforts specifically focused on reducing disparities in substance use disorders. Regulatory authorities recently made permanent the pandemic-era policy that allows opioid treatment patients to take home methadone doses, previously dispensed only onsite.\n\nBoth the House and Senate are engaged in reauthorizing the recently expired SUPPORT Act, though the outcome remains uncertain. The House passed a bill to reauthorize and extend the Act, focusing on reauthorizing programs and expanding support for prevention and treatment, workforce initiatives, and programs to address trauma. The House bill also includes several Medicaid-specific measures, such as making permanent the requirement that states cover medications for opioid use disorder, such as buprenorphine and methadone. Other Medicaid specific provisions include making the state plan amendment option to allow payment for treatment in institutions of mental disease (IMD) permanent, preventing Medicaid disenrollment due to incarceration, and expanding the CMS substance use disorder data book to include mental health conditions. It also proposes classifying Xylazine as a controlled substance and reevaluating the drug scheduling for medications that combine buprenorphine and naloxone (generally considered lower risk). The Senate will soon debate a separate version of the SUPPORT Act reauthorization, although the full details are not yet available. The Senate HELP Committee also marked up another bill aimed at broadening access to methadone by extending prescribing privileges to qualified practitioners outside of federally registered opioid treatment programs and allowing dispensing at pharmacies. Further, the FEND off Fentanyl Act, a bill that has recently been attracting attention, focuses on reducing the illicit supply of fentanyl.\n\nBroader state-level opportunities and challenges are at play in efforts to address the opioid epidemic. States are deciding how to use opioid settlement funds, but questions about state spending decisions and transparency have been raised. While some states and counties are using the funds to invest in treatment for uninsured, expand treatment infrastructure, and increase access to naloxone, some counties have made more questionable decisions\u2013such as using the settlement funds to plug holes in debt or purchase police patrol cars. Meanwhile, innovative state approaches to address the opioid epidemic have also emerged. For example, Pennsylvania built a \u201cwarm handoff\u201d program, which offers direct referrals to SUD treatment for overdose survivors, enhancing access to care. Similarly, to combat overdoses, some states are investing funds in installing vending machines stocked with Narcan. Despite these efforts, some state policies may present obstacles. For example, state laws that treat fentanyl test strips as drug paraphernalia and a lack of protections for individuals who prescribe or administer Narcan during an overdose may hinder progress in reducing opioid overdoses.\n\nMedicaid unwinding may lead to loss or interruptions in coverage for people who depend on Medicaid for OUD treatment, potentially disrupting their access to necessary treatment and increasing the risk of overdose and death. The recent resumption of Medicaid renewals following a three-year pandemic halt \u2013 \u2018Medicaid unwinding\u2019 \u2013 has led to millions individuals losing Medicaid coverage, primarily due to procedural reasons. Many people who lose Medicaid have alternative insurance options. However, for those who rely on Medicaid to cover OUD treatment, the loss of Medicaid coverage could disrupt their access to ongoing OUD treatment. Such a loss may disrupt treatment and increase overdose risks, especially in the midst of the ongoing fentanyl crisis that is recently further complicated by emerging threats like Nitazenes and Xylazine.",

        "authors": [],
        "text": "Opioids are a broad group of effective pain-relieving medicines that can become highly addictive in some individuals. According to government sources, nearly 40 million people are addicted to illicit drugs worldwide. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency. To combat the opioid epidemic, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine will develop an AI model that will more accurately predict opioid addiction in high-risk patients.\n\nThe project is funded through a three-year contract with Wellcome Leap as part of a $50 million groundbreaking initiative, called Untangling Addiction. The goal is to revolutionize how we understand opioid addiction and leverage innovative tools, such as artificial intelligence and predictive modeling, to intervene. UC San Diego School of Medicine was one of 14 locations worldwide to receive the funding.\n\n\u201cControlled opioids in the health care setting are still an important part of adequate pain control and used for standard care. However, it is critical to know who is receiving these drugs and the risk it carries with some patients,\u201d said Rodney Gabriel, MD, lead researcher for the project, chief of perioperative informatics in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and clinical director of anesthesiology at UC San Diego Health.\n\n\u201cThe AI model will help to identify who is most at risk for an opioid addiction and implement useful resources to help manage their opioid regimen. This way, we can better manage pain in this patient population and also avoid the potentially dangerous downstream consequences of addiction.\u201d\n\nThe model will use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), which can produce various types of content. It offers a more holistic approach, which can help with understanding and predicting multiple aspects of a patient's prior and future behaviors.\n\n\u201cGenAI provides more sophisticated ways to predict multiple outcomes based on patterns discovered from large patient datasets,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cWe want to better predict risk of addiction the moment a patient is given an opioid prescription to the moment they would start to become addicted.\u201d\n\nResearchers will develop electronic health record (EHR) foundation models in a secure platform, which will leverage large multi-institutional datasets to incorporate genomic, social determinants of health, clinical, procedural and demographic data to predict the development of opioid use disorder and related outcomes among any patient initially prescribed an opioid.\n\n\u201cAnesthesiologists have access to a variety of secure data, which we review to safely get a patient through surgery. Dr. Gabriel's research focus is how AI-assisted knowledge of a patient's risks can optimize their overall care, and in this particular instance, decrease the chances of addiction,\u201d said Ruth Waterman, MD, chair of the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and anesthesiologist at UC San Diego Health.\n\n\u201cWhat will be gained from this project will be translatable to many other areas of a patient's health care journey, resulting in better outcomes and care.\u201d\n\nWhen the predictive tool is ready to be tested in clinical settings, Gabriel and his team will partner with the Joan & Irwin Jacobs Center for Health Innovation at UC San Diego Health (JCHI), which provides a unique environment for integrating AI approaches into clinical care.\n\n\u201cJCHI will be an indispensable resource for computational, technical and collaborative needs,\u201d said Gabriel. \u201cOur project aligns with the vision of JCHI, in which we leverage AI to make impactful and significant changes for the future of medicine.\u201d\n\nFor Karandeep Singh, MD, who was named the inaugural chief health AI officer at UC San Diego Health, real-world evaluations of GenAI\u2019s potential are critical.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI has the potential to help us better understand people's risk, but this idea hasn't really been put to the test in most areas of medicine,\u201d said Singh. \u201cThis project will be key towards helping us understand the potential of generative AI in identifying opioid risk.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate goal of the project is to develop a commercially available genomic and microbiome panel that clinicians can use to easily assess opioid addiction, as well as to develop automated approaches using AI to integrate into EHR systems.\n\n\u201cThis will allow us to make real-time predictions of risk throughout a patient\u2019s entirety of care and lead the way in the prevention of opioid addiction,\u201d said Gabriel.",

        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 A couple of radio personalities are participating in a 12-week campaign to address the rise in overdose deaths in Black communities. While overdose deaths in Kentucky decreased by almost 10% from 2022 to 2023, among Black Kentuckians, there was a 5% increase, according to the 2023 Drug Overdose Fatality Report.\n\nThe rise in overdose deaths in Black communities has advocates and community members concerned. That\u2019s why the global public health organization Vital Strategies has brought a radio campaign to Louisville. Its purpose is to, \u201coutline the problem, explain to you what the problem is and then provide you the resources that you can use and where you can get those resources,\u201d said Gloria Malone, the senior manager of multimedia and digital strategies for the overdose prevention program at Vital Strategies.\n\nB96.5\u2019s on-air personality Bella Rae is one of the radio hosts who is taking part in the campaign. Having been born and raised in Louisville, she is passionate about issues that impact the community, and is particularly concerned about the impact the opioid crisis has had on Black communities.\n\n\u201cWe have to get the word out on overdoses and they are preventative,\u201d Bella Rae said.\n\nHer role with the campaign is to read out scripts that inform listeners about the issue and direct them to resources like Kentucky\u2019s online naloxone access portal or local nonprofits, like VOCAL-KY, that give out naloxone and fentanyl test strips.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be a part of this overdose campaign as a site where people, when they hear that radio show, they could come here and get the supplies they need,\u201d said Louisville Metro council member Shameka Parrish-Wright, District 3, who is also the executive director of VOCAL-KY.\n\nA Journal of the American Medical Association Health Forum survey found 32% of respondents know someone who has died from an overdose. Bella Rae has experience with this firsthand. Her best friend\u2019s brother died of an overdose in Dec. 2023.\n\n\u201cIt was something that was totally unexpected so her being able to push this and put this out in the forefront to where, you know, maybe this won\u2019t happen to somebody else\u2019s family, that means a lot to me,\u201d Brock said.\n\nThe campaign began on Aug. 5. While it\u2019s supposed to run for 12 weeks, Bella Rae hopes to make it longer.\n\nVital Strategies have worked with radio personalities to launch similar campaigns in Philadelphia and Milwaukee, reaching hundreds of thousands of listeners. This message reached more than 80% of Black adults in Philadelphia, according to Vital Strategies. In Milwaukee, it reached around 90% of Black adults.",

        "text": "When the history of the fentanyl crisis is written, 2023 may be remembered as the year Americans woke up to an unprecedented threat scouring communities - and a deepening cultural divide over what to do about it.\n\nFor the first time in U.S. history, fatal overdoses peaked above 112,000 deaths, with young people and people of color among the hardest hit.\n\nDrug policy experts, and people living with addiction, say the magnitude of this calamity now eclipses every previous drug epidemic, from crack cocaine in the 1980s to the prescription opioid crisis of the 2000s.\n\n\"We've had an entire community swept away,\" said Louise Vincent, a harm reduction activist in North Carolina, who says she still sometimes uses street opioids including fentanyl.\n\n\"We do have fentanyl that's dangerous, we have xylazine that's poison,\" Vincent told NPR. \"We've had an entire community swept away. I can't even think of all the people I know who have died. My daughter died. Our mentors are dead. It is so dangerous right now.\"\n\nPublic health experts say fentanyl, a synthetic opioid far more powerful than heroin, is responsible for the majority of drug deaths. But the supply of illegal drugs is increasingly complex and perilous.\n\nAmericans using drugs recreationally, or caught up in more serious addiction, face an unpredictable cocktail that often includes fentanyl, methamphetamines and fast-changing mix of new chemicals.\n\nThe latest threats include the horse tranquilizer xylazine, which causes lingering flesh wounds in users, and nitazenes, synthetic opioids that appear to be even more potent than fentanyl.\n\nOften Mexican drug cartels press these chemicals into pills, which are counterfeited to resemble pharmaceutical-grade medications for ADHD, depression, and pain.\n\n\"This is why it's so important for you to understand that you cannot just simply pick up a drug and go ahead and use it,\" said professor Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, head of Stanford University's REACH Lab, which focuses on understanding, preventing and reducing teen and young adult substance use.\n\nFederal researchers now say drug overdoses are a leading cause of death among young Americans age 18-45 and have also spiked as a killer of pregnant women.\n\nThe issue has become a major flashpoint for politicians, with many Republican politicians blasting the Biden administration for failing to stop fentanyl smugglers.\n\n\"We've had more Americans die of fentanyl than the Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam wars, combined,\" said Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who is now seeking the GOP presidential nomination, speaking to voters in New Hampshire on Dec. 14.\n\nHopes dashed for a quick solution to the overdose crisis\n\nDrug deaths first began to soar in the U.S. in early 2020 - from an already devastating 65,000 a year - to what policy makers fear is a new baseline of more than 110,000 a year.\n\nAt first public health experts linked the carnage to the Covid pandemic, when lockdowns disrupted addiction treatment programs and heightened isolation.\n\nBut predictions that this new overdose crisis would fade as American life returned to normal have evaporated.\n\n\"It continues to go up,\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the nation's top drug policy and addiction research agency, in an interview with NPR.\n\n\"I had been hoping after we emerged from the Covid pandemic, we would start to see it go down. It hasn't continued to rise as sharply, but it's rising.\"\n\nIn 2023 the overdose death rate topped 112,000 in a 12 month period for the first time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBiden administration officials say they have \"flattened\" the upward curve.\n\nBut speaking this month during a press conference in Maryland, White House drug czar Dr. Rahul Gupta acknowledged the gravity of the public health crisis.\n\n\"We cannot treat dead people,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Gupta, federal spending on the crisis has surged, with roughly 40% more dollars flowing to the states.\n\nThere have been other policy gains in 2023, including approval of over-the-counter-sales of naloxone, a medication that can reverse most opioid overdoses.\n\n\"We have to do more,\" Gupta acknowledged \"We have to make that sure we're getting people the help they need [with addiction] and we have to go after the trafficking profits [of drug dealers].\"\n\nA U.S. drug death every 4 1/2 minutes and no quick fixes\n\nWhy aren't these policy responses doing more to help?\n\nExperts point out that much of the government funding spent on to addiction in the U.S. actually goes to pay for law enforcement and drug interdiction, funding police, prisons and border security.\n\nAccording to the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, total annual spending on the drug war now tops $40 billion a year.\n\nMost drug policy experts agree this vast system failed to detect or stop the rapid spread of more toxic synthetic street drugs.\n\nEfforts to weaken fentanyl production and smuggling by Chinese chemical manufacturers and Mexican drug cartels have failed to curb the supply in American communities.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, law enforcement seized \"more than 360 million deadly doses\" of fentanyl in 2023, but the drug remains cheap and widely available.\n\nMeanwhile, the network of roughly 17,000 drug rehab and treatment centers across the U.S. is often described as a \"wild west\" of expensive, poorly regulated and unscientific programs.\n\nMost offer abstinence-based care, which means people experiencing addiction can't get help until they're ready or able to stop taking drugs. Experts say that leaves millions of fentanyl-users - and people experiencing other substance use disorders - vulnerable.\n\nIn 2023, New Hampshire Public Radio highlighted the widespread dysfunction in the treatment industry, airing a podcast series The Thirteenth Step that investigated allegations of sexual abuse of clients in the drug treatment system.\n\n\"The [government] oversight that does exist, it's just not capable of finding unethical behavior like this,\" said NHPR senior reporter Lauren Chooljian in an interview with NPR.\n\nAs deaths soar, more families and communities turn to \"harm reduction\"\n\nOne more challenge is the mainstream medical community, which has largely resisted helping with the crisis.\n\nFederal regulators have lowered barriers for doctors to use proven medical treatments for opioid addiction and overdose, especially buprenorphine and naloxone.\n\nBut a study published in July 2023 in the Journal of the American Medical Association found most physicians don't prescribe these medications to their patients.\n\nLeft with few options, many communities, grassroots organizations and families have turned increasingly to a strategy that's been used in other countries known as \"harm reduction.\"\n\nIt's a healthcare approach designed to keep people alive while they use drugs, until they're able to enter into some kind of recovery.\n\nStrategies include handing out naloxone; distributing clean needles and pipes so that people don't share equipment and spread disease; and offering basic medical care and counseling.\n\nSome harm reduction workers also monitor people actively using drug use to help prevent fatal overdoses.\n\n\"People die of overdoses because they're by themselves,\" said Renae, a harm reduction worker who believes this approach can also reduce stigma and help healing.\n\n\"The stuff [access to safer drug use] is just the carrot I dangle before the horse, I'm wanting to make a connection,\" she told NPR.\n\nNPR is not using Renae's full name because some of what she does to help keep people alive, like supervising active drug use, is illegal.\n\nIn 2023, a growing backlash against \"de-stigmatizing\" drug use\n\nWhile programs like supervised drug use sites are widely accepted in Canada and parts of Europe, they remain controversial in the U.S. and the backlash against helping active drug users appears to be growing.\n\nVoters decriminalized drug use in Oregon in November 2020, but the policy has since faced a sharp decline in popularity and many politicians and voters want to toughen the state's drug laws again.\n\nIn December 2023, one of the country's leading thinkers on drug addiction, Stanford University researcher Keith Humphreys, published an essay in The Atlantic arguing that progressive approaches to the fentanyl crisis have failed.\n\n\"Empathy for people in the clutch of addiction is noble, and finding ways to help them is a moral necessity,\" Humphreys wrote, along with co-author Jonathan Caulkins from Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nThey argue that destigmatizing drug use \"is a profoundly mistaken approach\" that fails to encourage users to seek full recovery.\n\nHarm reduction advocates generally acknowledge their approach doesn't offer a silver bullet to the overdose crisis.\n\nBut many say they've been unfairly blamed for a drug epidemic that has spiraled out of control.\n\n\"We too are distressed by what we see in the street,\" said Kassandra Frederique, head of the Drug Policy Alliance, a group that advocates for decriminalization of drug use.\n\n\"While we do not agree with coercion or incarceration, we're also grasping to see what is going work. Not because it's some theoretical framework we're pushing but because we want it to work for our loved ones,\" she told NPR.\n\n$50 billion in drug company money is slow to help the crisis\n\nAnother once-hopeful strategy for reducing drug deaths also appears to be tangled up in a growing muddle of political arguments and bureaucracy.\n\nOver the last decade, drug companies that fueled the first wave of the opioid crisis by aggressively marketing and distributing pain pills, agreed to pay more than $50 billion in compensation to communities battling addiction.\n\nBut despite the urgency of the crisis, many states have left most of their funds unspent.\n\nSome states, including Colorado and Rhode Island, have moved to invest more resources in programs like naloxone distribution and mental health programs for kids.\n\nBut many communities are spending the money on law enforcement budgets and on police equipment including patrol cars, roadside cameras and body scanners for jails.\n\nThat angers some family-members, including Carrie Spears in Ohio, who lost her 23-year-old nephew Tanner to a fentanyl overdose in 2021.\n\n\"It's not that I don't support law enforcement or first responders,\" Spears told NPR and KFF Health News. \"But what research did they look at that said, yeah, surveillance equipment and canine [police units] help people get into recovery and sobriety?\"\n\nWhat comes next? The politics of fentanyl in 2024\n\nPublic health experts worry debates over how to help people in addiction survive and recover will intensify and grow even more divisive in an election year.\n\nDemocratic and Republican politicians have promised to stop or sharply curtail fentanyl smuggling from the Mexico into the U.S., but analysts tell NPR no one has proposed a plan that would accomplish that goal.\n\n\"The war on drugs hasn't worked,\" said Ioan Grillo, a Mexico City-based journalist considered an expert on the Mexican drug cartels, in an April 2023 interview with NPR.\n\n\"We've got more deaths from drug overdose than ever, we've got more violence between drug cartels in Mexico than ever.\"\n\nReal solutions to the overdose crisis are likely to be complex, costly and time-consuming, especially if the street drug supply keeps evolving with more dangerous chemicals.\n\nExperts say the most hopeful strategies will likely involve things like reforming healthcare, expanding access to housing and mental health programs.\n\nEveryone interviewed for this story said doing that kind of work in 2024, at a time when Congress and the electorate are increasingly polarized, will be nearly impossible \u2014 even if drug deaths keep rising.\n\n-Lee Gaines of WFYI, April Laissle of WFDD, and NPR Education editor Nicole Cohen contributed reporting for this story",

        "text": "OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) \u2014 The Washington state attorney general announced a $149.5 million settlement Wednesday with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, more than four years after the state sued the company over its role fueling the opioid addiction crisis.\n\nAttorney General Bob Ferguson\u2019s announcement came as opioid overdose deaths have risen across the state, with 2,048 in 2022 \u2014 more than twice as many deaths as there were in 2019, according to the most recent numbers from the Washington State Department of Health.\n\nUnder the deal, the state and local governments would have to spend $123.3 million to address the opioid crisis, including on substance abuse treatment, expanded access to overdose-reversal drugs and services that support pregnant women on substances. The rest of the money would go toward litigation costs.\n\nThe settlement agreement still requires approval from a judge. If approved, the deal would send over $20 million more to respond to the opioid crisis than if the state had signed onto a national settlement in 2021 involving Johnson & Johnson, the attorney general\u2019s office said.\n\nSince the 2000s, drugmakers, wholesalers, pharmacy chains and consultants have agreed to pay more than $50 billion to state and local governments to settle claims that they played a part in creating the opioid crisis.\n\nUnder the agreements, most of the money is to be used to combat the nation\u2019s addiction and overdose crisis.\n\nREAD MORE: McKinsey and Co. agrees to $78 million settlement over claims it helped fuel opioid crisis\n\nDrug overdoses caused more than 1 million deaths in the U.S. from 1999 through 2021, and the majority of those involved opioids. At first, the crisis centered on prescription painkillers that gained more acceptance in the 1990s, and later heroin. Over the past decade, the death toll has reached an all-time high, and the biggest killers have been synthetic opioids such as fentanyl that are in the supply of many street drugs.\n\nWashington state\u2019s Democratic attorney general sued Johnson & Johnson in 2020, alleging that it helped drive the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s expansion of prescription opioids. He also claimed that the company made a distinct mark on Washington\u2019s opioid crisis by deceiving doctors and the public about the effectiveness of opioids for chronic pain and the risk of addiction.\n\nJohnson & Johnson said in a written statement Monday that Duragesic, its fentanyl patch, and its Nucynta opioid accounted for less than 1 percent of opioid prescriptions in the state and the U.S., adding that it has not sold prescription opioid medications in the country in years.\n\n\u201cThe Company\u2019s actions relating to the marketing and promotion of important prescription opioid medications were appropriate and responsible,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office noted that the company was one of the largest suppliers of the raw narcotic materials needed to produce opioid drugs.\n\nFunds will be awarded by the end of this fiscal year, which means that the Legislature can earmark the money during the current legislative session. Half of the money will go to a state account, while the other half will go to an account for local governments, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nThe deal comes about two years after the nation\u2019s three largest opioid distributors agreed to pay the state $518 million, with the vast majority being directed toward easing the addiction epidemic.\n\nAP reporter Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed.",

            "Carrie MacMillan"
        ],
        "text": "OxyContin contributed to a modern opioid epidemic with lasting repercussions, and now fentanyl has brought the overdose crisis to a new level.\n\nAlthough both are highly addictive opioids (a class of drugs with pain-relieving and euphoria-inducing properties), fentanyl is purely synthetic, meaning it can be made easily and cheaply in a lab, and it is more potent\u2014about 50 to 100 times stronger\u2014than many prescription opioids.\n\nIn 2022, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), close to 83,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the United States, the majority from fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic substances.\n\nFentanyl isn\u2019t new; it has been used in the U.S. since 1960 as an intravenous anesthetic. It is still prescribed today by doctors, often in the form of patches and lozenges, for treating severe and chronic pain from cancer and other illnesses and injuries.\n\nBut fentanyl has shifted from exclusively being produced by pharmaceutical companies to now also coming from drug cartels and other entities, says David Fiellin, MD, a Yale Medicine primary care physician who specializes in addiction medicine. \u201cWe refer to it as illicitly manufactured fentanyl,\u201d he says.\n\nDrug dealers are increasingly mixing fentanyl into all kinds of drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines. They also put it in fake prescription pills, including oxycodone (OxyContin\u00ae\u2014one kind of oxycodone), hydrocodone (Vicodin\u00ae), and benzodiazepines\u2014a type of sedative medication used for anxiety\u2014such as diazepam (Valium\u00ae), that are sold on the street.\n\n\u201cDealers package it to look like a normal prescription pill that you would get at the pharmacy, but nobody can tell what's in it,\u201d explains Dr. Fiellin. \u201cSo, someone buys from a drug dealer what they think is Valium, or cocaine, or OxyContin, but it has a small amount of fentanyl in it that the buyer is unaware of. This can cause an overdose because the individual doesn\u2019t have the physical tolerance to fentanyl, even if they have a tolerance to, say, OxyContin.\u201d\n\nIn many cases, however, people who use or overdose on fentanyl are knowingly taking the drug because of the intense high it delivers.\n\nWe spoke with Dr. Fiellin, who answered our questions about illicitly manufactured fentanyl.\n\nThe conversation below has been edited for clarity.\n\nIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that the U.S. has, over the last 100 years, had an opioid in one form or another that people were misusing, and that has led to addiction\u2014the formal term is opioid use disorder.\n\nOver the years, the misused opioid changed from opium to morphine to heroin, which grew in prevalence during the 1960s and 1970s. And then, in the 2000s, we saw a surge of prescription opioids that were being diverted from those that were prescribed to people for chronic pain [to the illicit marketplace]; people started misusing the diverted supply instead of\u2014or in addition to\u2014heroin.\n\nAnd now, since 2015 or 2016, the opioid street supply in the U.S. has shifted from primarily heroin and prescription opioids to illicitly manufactured fentanyl. One reason is that because fentanyl is easy to manufacture, it is easy to ship around the country.\n\nAnd because of its potency, it takes a small amount of fentanyl to create the effect of analgesia [the absence of pain] or euphoria or to help people avoid the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The potency also presents a high risk for overdose.\n\nThere is a phrase in medicine: \u2018Consider the host.\u2019 It means that an individual substance or disease will behave differently depending on the host\u2014or person\u2014exposed to it.\n\nSome people use opioids daily for months or even years. Their level of physical tolerance, or the amount of opioids their bodies can process, is far higher than that of another person who has rarely or never taken the drugs.\n\nAlso, tolerance can rise over time. A person may start with a dose of one, two, or three milligrams and, over years of use, can take up to, say, 50 milligrams. As tolerance and, with it, physical dependence increase, people need ever-higher doses of a substance to get the same effect\u2014be it pain relief, treatment of opioid withdrawal, or euphoria.\n\nBut an individual who doesn't use opioids regularly could overdose on a very small amount, and that's what we're seeing with fentanyl. Or, someone who regularly uses opioids might misjudge or be unaware of the amount of fentanyl in the supply they're using and get twice or three times as much as they anticipated, and they will overdose.\n\nFentanyl test strips are small strips of paper treated with a chemical that detects the presence of fentanyl in different kinds of drugs. Though these are not legal in all states, we're very much in favor of fentanyl test strips in general because they help people be more aware of the drug supply and things that they may or may not want to be exposed to. That\u2019s part of the principle of harm reduction [more on that below].\n\nBut they're not foolproof. If you test one corner of a pill, it may not have the same result as another corner of the same pill, because the pills aren't manufactured like something from a pharmacy\u2014their content is not uniform.\n\nThe other thing about the test strips is they can be very useful if somebody only uses cocaine, for example; they can test the cocaine to make sure there\u2019s no fentanyl in it. But as I mentioned, even if fentanyl is not in the substance, there may be something else, such as a nitazene or carfentanil, that the strips will miss. So, it's important for people to use the test strips but also to recognize that they're not always 100% accurate.\n\nTest strips are mostly available through treatment or harm reduction providers. People can try NEXT Distro or their state's Department of Public Health. I don't believe they're reimbursed by insurance, but they're relatively inexpensive.",

The day is also about raising awareness.\n\n\u201cThe overdose crisis is often looked at as an issue for those struggling with addiction, but when there is a tainted supply of drugs, overdoses can become a reality,\u201d said Gladding.\n\nA big message from nearly everyone who spoke at the local event was there is no one face of the crisis as every addiction is different, and so to are the people impacted. In 2023, 16 people died in Perth County due to overdoses, up 11 from the previous year.\n\nIn 2023, there were 2,645 opioid toxicity deaths reported. Between 2020 and January of this year consumption and treatment services reversed nearly 21,000 overdoses in Ontario, keeping people out of hospitals.\n\nA 2021 study found that 60 percent of those hospitalized from opioid toxicity were people who were employed. The most vulnerable sectors are construction, mining, oil, and gas sectors.\n\nAnd the crisis isn\u2019t just impacting adults. Behind alcohol, opioids are the most commonly used substance by high school students. There was a 70 percent increase in opioid use from 2021 to 2023.\n\n\u201cThis crisis involves real people, that could be a brother or sister, a child, these are real families living in our community,\u201d said Perth-Wellington MP John Nater.\n\nThe local MP added \u201cThis community has done a great job in reducing the stigmas around mental health and addictions, but we also know more work needs to be done.\u201d\n\nMPP Matthew Rae brought greetings from the provincial government, and thanked everyone for attending, and showed support to first responders.\n\nMayor Martin Ritsma was in attendance and said \u201cMy wife tells me that we don\u2019t know the true number of people dealing with mental health and addictions in our community who are just trying to make it work.\u201d\n\nThe Mayor also applauded the work being done by CMHA, and other organizations in the community. Three chairs were placed in front of the microphone, two large and one little chair.\n\n\u201cThese empty chairs represent empty chairs at your kitchen table, or living room, the chair once occupied by someone no longer with us,\u201d said Gladding.\n\nA local mother shared the heart-wrenching story of how her daughter has battled with addictions for a number of years, but got clean, got a job and went to school, before relapsing after the birth of her child. The child at 20 months old then died of an overdose after getting into her mothers drugs while the mother slept. The mother, who lost her granddaughter, also had to lose her daughter to jail for four years due to the accident. To this day, her daughter continues to suffer with addiction.",

        "title": "The Opioid Epidemic: How to Protect Your Family",
        "authors": [],
        "text": "Drug overdoses are a leading cause of unintentional death in the United States. The major force behind this epidemic is prescription and non-prescription opioid drugs. All ages and communities everywhere are affected by opioid addiction.\n\nOpioids were involved in 80,411 overdose deaths in 2021. That represented more than 75% of all U.S. drug overdose deaths. Growing numbers of these deaths are from an illegal form of a powerful synthetic opioid called fentanyl. The rapid rise in deaths from these synthetic opioids, including a sharp increase among adolescents, is especially alarming.\n\nTreating and preventing opioid use disorder is a responsibility we all must share. Here's why it is important for families to have access to the care they need, including help with drug addiction.\n\nWhat are opioids?\n\nOpioids are a category of highly addictive narcotic drugs. They include prescription pain medicine and illegal substances like heroin. Opioids are a class of drugs synthetic or semi-synthetic versions, of the opium produced in small amounts by opium poppy plants. Large doses can slow the body's heart and breathing rate to the point of stopping completely.\n\nExamples of opioid medication used nonmedically\n\nOxycodone\u2014Found in brands such as OxyContin, Percodan, Percocet, Oxecta, Oxycet, and Roxicodone. Kicker, 30s, 40s, 512s, Oxy, O.C. Beans, Blues, Buttons, Cotton, Kickers, Killers, Percs, and Roxy are among street names for this drug.\n\nFentanyl \u2014Including Actiq, Duragesic, Fentora, Lazanda and Sublimaze, is 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin. Street names for fentanyl or for fentanyl-laced heroin include Apache, Birria, Blonde, Blue Diamond, China Buffet, China White, China Girl, Dance Fever, Facebook, Friend, Goodfella, Jackpot, Murder 8, Snowflake, TNT, Tango and Cash, White Ladies.\n\nHydrocodone or dihydrocodeinone\u2014Found in Vicodin, Norco, Zohydro, Hysingla Co-gesic, Liquicet, Lorcet, Dolacet, Anexsia, Zydone, and Xodol. Common street names for the pill version and cough syrup forms are Robo or Tuss, Vikes, Veeks, Idiot Pills, Scratch, 357s, Lemonade, Bananas, Dones, Droco, and Lorries.\n\nCodeine, like hydrocodone\u2014Sometimes found in cough syrup form, so it may be called syrup on the street. Brands of acetaminophen, such as Tylenol, that include codeine might be called schoolboy or Cody.\n\nMorphine\u2014Including brands such as AVINza or Kadian. It may be referred to as Mister blue or dreamer.\n\nHow opioid use can evolve into addiction\n\nOpioids produce short-term positive feelings, by mimicking the body's natural endorphins or \"feel good\" hormones. In addition to decreased pain, people who use opioids may feel a \"rush\" or \"high,\" improved mood, and/or reduced anxiety or stress. These effects are short-lived.\n\nWith continued use, people quickly develop tolerance to opioids. This means they need higher doses to experience the same effects. When people stop using opioids, they may experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sweating, and flu-like symptoms. Some people continue to use opioids, even if they know they shouldn't and want to stop, because they want to relieve and prevent withdrawal.\n\nPeople who have started to develop an addiction to prescription opioids may start buying counterfeit pills or try another opioid, such as heroin or fentanyl, to treat pain and prevent withdrawal symptoms. Statistics show that 4 out of 5 new individuals consuming heroin started by taking prescription painkillers for nonmedical purposes.\n\nThe opioid epidemic's effect on children & teens\n\nOpioid addiction breaks apart families\n\nNonmedical use of opioids affects the entire family. Families may be broken apart when a parent is arrested and sent to jail for buying or selling opioids. Parents who develop addiction may be unable to prioritize the needs of their family and children.\n\nPrenatal exposure to opioids & NOWS\n\nBabies exposed to opioids during pregnancy can be born with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). Federal reports show that a baby with NOWS was born every 15 minutes. Facing lengthy hospital stays, babies with NOWS are more likely to have low birthweight, trouble breathing and difficulty eating. They may also experience seizures and tremors. Doctors encourage pregnant people who use opioids to reach out for treatment, recovery care, and other services.\n\nOpioid poisoning & overdose\n\nNearly 9,000 U.S. children and adolescents died from opioid poisonings between 1999 and 2016, at a rate that nearly tripled. Most were teens, but there were also steady increases in opioid-related deaths among younger children.\n\nToday, research shows that opioids are the most common substance contributing to fatal poisonings among children age 5 and under.\n\n5 things parents can do about nonmedical opioid use\n\n1. Talk to your kids about drug use\n\nChildren who learn about the risks of drugs at home are less likely to use drugs than those who don't learn this at home. Start talking about medication safety early by advising young children not to take any pills without asking you first.\n\nAs children grow older and are more likely to view images of alcohol and drug use in media and advertisements, use those opportunities to open a conversation. Ask your child to explain what they know about alcohol and drugs, and use simple language to explain your rules around alcohol and drugs and that they are harmful, and sometimes can result in injury, overdose, or death. As children grow into teens, ask them about what they see at school or with their peers. Share information about the risks of drug and alcohol, and continue to reinforce your rules and expectations around alcohol and drug use.\n\nMake sure your teen understands the legal problems with sharing opioid medications. Also emphasize that many pills that are supposedly prescription drugs are illicitly manufactured and contaminated with fentanyl. Likewise, other substances such as cannabis may also be adulterated with opioids.\n\n2. Store medicines safely & dispose of leftover prescriptions\n\nKeep opioids and other prescription medicine up and away in a secure place. Count and monitor the number of pills you have and lock them up. Do not allow your child or teen unsupervised access to these medications. Never let your child take someone else's prescription medication. In 2021, nearly half (45%) of people 12 and older who used pain relievers nonmedically said they were given by, bought from, or taken from a friend or relative.\n\nAlso be sure to return leftover prescriptions to a hospital, doctor's office, or pharmacy. Many communities offer \"take-back\" events to collect unused prescription medications.\n\n3. If your child is in pain, work with your doctor to create a safe pain management plan\n\nIf your child has a surgical procedure, you may be concerned about how to help your child manage pain and discomfort. Many people believe opioids work best for pain. However, recent studies show that non-opioid medicines such as ibuprofen and naproxen, as well as non-medical approaches can be just as effective. Your doctor may suggest trying certain complementary and alternative treatments\u2014such as acupuncture\u2014as a first step for treating and managing chronic pain.\n\nIf your child continues to have severe pain, your doctor may prescribe a pain reliever that contains an opioid. If your child is prescribed an opioid it is important to monitor your child's use of it. It should be taken exactly as prescribed, and for the shortest time necessary. Also consider talking with the doctor about co-prescribing naloxone, which can prevent opioid overdose deaths, whenever an opioid is prescribed.\n\n4. Ask for help if your child is using opioids nonmedically\n\nIf you think you or your child may be using opioids nonmedically, or any medication nonmedically, don't hesitate to seek help. Your child's pediatrician can explain how medication treatment can help teen and young adult patients with opioid use disorders, or refer them to other providers who can. Similar treatment is available for pregnant individuals with opioid use disorder.\n\n5. Know what to do in an opioid overdose emergency\n\nAsk your pediatrician about using naloxone in an overdose emergency. Learn the signs of a possible overdose, such as difficulty and shallow breathing, severe sleepiness, and not being able to wake up. Always call 911 if you believe someone is experiencing an overdose, even if you give them naloxone.\n\nMore information",

        ],
        "text": "Last year, Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s Center on Society and Health collaborated with the Virginia Department of Health to calculate how much the opioid epidemic cost Virginians financially in 2020, including families, businesses and government agencies. New data collection methods introduced in 2021 now suggest that the prevalence and economic impact of opioid addiction was underestimated in previous reports.\n\nThe data from 2021 revealed that nearly 150,000 people in Virginia had an opioid use disorder, 127% higher than 2020 estimates, with at least six Virginians dying of an opioid drug overdose every day on average. The calculator revealed that the overall cost of the epidemic in 2021 was more than $5 billion, which is 43% higher than 2020 estimates. On an individual level, the financial impact of the opioid epidemic amounted to $588 per Virginian on average.\n\n\u201cOpioid addiction has been an increasing issue in the United States for the last several years, and these shocking estimates underscore the tremendous financial cost of this epidemic, which has a devastating impact on individuals, their families and communities,\u201d said Derek Chapman, Ph.D., interim director of the VCU Center on Society and Health. \u201cA comprehensive strategy focusing on prevention, treatment and recovery is needed to reverse these troubling trends.\u201d\n\nThe opioid cost calculator was first released in October 2022 and used data collected in 2020 by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With this data, the research team developed analytical models to estimate productivity, health care costs and government losses from the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe increased reports of opioid use in 2021 were in part due to changes in the NSDUH\u2019s survey methods to provide a more accurate estimate of the epidemic\u2019s impact. In the 2020 survey, questions about substance use disorder were given only to individuals who abused prescription drugs, such as taking them for longer periods of time or in larger amounts than what was prescribed. However, even when prescription drugs are used as intended, people can still be at risk of developing addiction.\n\n\u201cProviders are careful to follow clinical recommendations for managing patient pain and consider many factors before prescribing opioids,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cHowever, a person could be taking their prescription drugs as prescribed and still experience symptoms of substance use disorder, such as feeling unable to stop taking opioids, having intense cravings, developing withdrawal symptoms or not being able to carry out responsibilities at work or home.\u201d\n\nTo gain a more comprehensive understanding of the opioid epidemic, the 2021 survey asked any persons who took prescription drugs a series of questions to determine whether they had a substance use disorder.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the increase in our estimates between 2020 and 2021 reflects a better ascertainment of the problem in the 2021 NSDUH survey compared to the 2020 survey methods. However, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that opioid deaths also increased by 17% between 2020 and 2021, so it is likely that opioid use disorder increased by at least that much,\u201d Chapman noted.\n\nThe cost calculator shows not only the overall cost of the epidemic in Virginia in total dollars but also provides breakdowns by sector (labor, health care, crime), payer (households, state/local government, federal government) and locality (counties and independent cities).\n\nThe majority of costs from the opioid epidemic were shouldered by Virginia families and businesses through lost labor (such as lost wages) due to missed work, incarceration or death from opioids. Federal, state and local governments were also financially impacted due to loss of income tax revenues, increased opioid-related health care costs and higher expenditures required within the criminal justice system, child and family services, and K-12 education.\n\nThe impact of the opioid epidemic varied among Virginia localities, with communities in Petersburg, Norton, Richmond City, Portsmouth, Hopewell, King and Queen County, Fredericksburg and Roanoke experiencing the greatest financial costs related to addiction.\n\nThe researchers hope the cost calculator helps raise awareness of the devastating impact of opioid addiction in Virginia and supports ongoing efforts by policymakers and community partners toward creating systemic change at state and local levels.\n\n\u201cThis calculator shows the value of investing in measures for prevention, treatment and recovery from opioids, such as treating mental health disorders, continuing to carefully monitor opioid prescriptions and providing more resources for those with substance addiction,\u201d Chapman said.\n\nWhile the numbers mentioned in this study are important for understanding the economic consequences of opioid addiction in Virginia, there are other harmful effects that can\u2019t be reduced to a dollar amount.\n\n\u201cThe reduced quality of life from addiction and the emotional costs of losing loved ones to opioids are incalculable and add to the urgency of addressing this issue,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on being around for birthdays, graduations and time spent with family and friends.\u201d",

        "title": "ODU Investigators Seek to Address Opioid Epidemic Within Black Communities in Hampton Roads",
        "authors": [],
        "text": "By Victoria Bourne\n\nIn August 2021, the Virginia Gazette reported that the rate at which Black people in Hampton Roads died from opioid overdoses jumped from 11.8 to 27.9 per 100,000 of the population between 2019 and 2020.\n\nFor the first time, more Black people died from opioid overdoses than white people statewide in 2020, and Black men experienced the highest fatal opioid overdose ever recorded: 45.5 per 100,000.\n\nImpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 isolation, job loss \u2014 as well as mistrust between Black communities and recovery health care resources, were highlighted as contributing factors. Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have been fueling the crisis. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 220 people died each day from an opioid overdose in 2021 nationwide.\n\nA group of investigators from Old Dominion University, led by associate professor Shuntay Tarver, are hoping to shine a light on existing gaps between those needing help to treat their opioid addiction and those providing treatment. They want to establish a framework that removes barriers to care such as cultural stigma, threat of family separation and economic issues that discourage help-seeking behaviors.\n\nTheir efforts are specifically aimed at decreasing opioid and substance use among Black families across Norfolk, Newport News and Hampton by tapping into the collective power of small churches, grassroots organizations and other community stakeholders.\n\n\u201cI do want to be clear that regional coalitions exist. They exist in Norfolk, they exist in Hampton, they exist in Newport News and of course in all of these surrounding cities. But making sure that (services) are accessible to the most vulnerable populations is our goal,\u201d said Tarver, who is serving as principal investigator on a two-year $150,000 community planning grant awarded by the Jeffress Trust foundation.\n\n\u201cSo, it's really about assessing what's going on, finding out what the gaps are, and making those things accessible to those who need it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe team includes ODU adjunct instructor Tamika Lett and assistant professor Chaniece Winfield. Latiesha Handie, director of youth and young adult opportunities for Hampton, is also part of the effort.\n\nA trio of ODU undergraduates are a part of the team as well, Tarver said. Their participation offers them not only traditional research opportunities such as data collection and analysis but also hands on exposure to see that data at work in the community, which greatly enriches their educational experiences, Tarver said.\n\nIn May, Tarver was named interim dean of the Perry Honors College after serving for several months as associate dean. A principal responsibility of her new role relates to undergraduate research.\n\n\u201cNow I can teach more people how to use these empirical tools to do the work of the community,\u201d Tarver said.\n\nDriven by personal experience\n\nTarver said most of her professional journey has been experientially driven. The reason she pursued social work is intimately tied to being the survivor of a parent who committed suicide, she said. But in all her years as a practitioner, she had never really focused on substance abuse.\n\n\"That wasn't my thing, it wasn't a part of my story,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't think there's a person that's not touched by substance use in some capacity, but it didn't hit center stage for me until 2017.\"\n\nThat year she was a member of a small church in Hampton, where she lives. Tarver and a \"dear sister,\" named Tanya with whom she was part of the church\u2019s praise team and choir, were leading a women's ministry retreat. They began talking about breaking the stigmas surrounding mental health and addiction.\n\n\"Through this work with her, I became aware of her journey with struggling with addiction,\" Tarver said. She learned her friend was relapsing.\n\nIn early December of that year, Tarver joined a rotation of other church members as they supported Tanya, who was trying to kick her addiction by going cold-turkey and was experiencing active withdrawals. Tarver had never seen anything like it before, she said \u2013 she was taken aback.\n\n\u201cYou're thirsty, but you can't keep water down. You're cold. You're shaking. And I'm confused,\u201d Tarver recalled.\n\nEven as she battled the effects of withdrawal, Tarver\u2019s friend teased her as Tarver sought out more information online to try to help.\n\n\u201cI'm Googling and talking to her. She's laughing at me 'cause I'm Googling. She's like, \u2018You're such a nerd.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo months later, Tarver got the call that Tanya had died from an opioid overdose, leaving behind a 5-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cI immediately thought, \u2018What else should we have done?\u2019\u201d Tarver said. \u201cWe couldn't pray it away; trust me. I was praying with her, too.\"\n\nThe experience inspired Tarver to reach out to community partners to conduct a small pilot study funded by the National Organization of Human Services.\n\n\"We interviewed pastor after pastor about their preparedness to address issues of addiction in their congregation,\u201d Tarver said. \u201cMost people had no idea where to go or what to do, let alone the resources that exist.\u201d\n\nThat work eventually led to the development of the planning grant Tarver and her co-investigators submitted to Jeffress Trust, and for which they received funding in July 2023.\n\nThe Thomas F. and Kate Miller Jeffress Memorial Trust, founded in 1981 by Robert M. Jeffress in memory of his parents, supports medical and scientific research across the state. In past years, it has focused on supporting scientists and research in fields like astrophysics, mathematical biology and drug development. In 2022, the awards program shifted gears toward supporting research that advances health equity for all Virginians by addressing the root causes and systemic barriers that drive inequity.\n\nJackie Stein, ODU's director of research and development, said it is a highly competitive grant and Tarver and her team are among the first cohort to be awarded under the program\u2019s redefined mission.\n\n\"It's a brilliant choice of project,\u201d Stein said, adding that it will \u201cdo a better job of meeting people where they are, and that is what's going to help get people into services that will benefit them.\"\n\n\u201cI see this as a huge point of pride for the University,\u201d she said.\n\nGetting to work\n\nEducation and needs assessments are key components to their work, according to Tarver's co-investigators.\n\n\u201cThere's a lack of education surrounding treatment for opioids,\" said Lett, an ODU alumna \u2014 who was recently named by the University\u2019s Alumni Association among its top 40 under 40 \u2014 and adjunct instructor in the Department of Counseling and Human Services.\n\nLett is a certified diversity professional and substance abuse counselor with more than two decades of experience. She said there is skepticism within Black and brown communities regarding medication-assisted treatment for opioids, which combines prescription medication such as Buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone with counseling and behavioral therapies to help people recover from opioid dependency.\n\n\"A lot of the individuals in the minority communities stray away from services because of mistrust, thinking they're going to break the family up, they're going to go to jail,\u201d Lett said.\n\nHistorically, those kinds of experiences have disproportionately impacted Black families compared to white families, she noted. Strides have been made more recently toward keeping families together and including them as part of a person\u2019s substance use treatment journey, she added.\n\n\u201cBut a lot of them don't know this,\u201d Lett said.\n\nThere are also misconceptions about Good Samaritan laws, which protect people who call to report an overdose. And in some instances, a church may host a Narcotics Anonymous group but has had no training on how to administer Narcan, a medication that can reverse an overdose from opioids.\n\n\"It's just really sad because we could be saving more lives if we have more education surrounding these safety measures that have been put in place,\" Lett said.\n\nPart of the team\u2019s work is assessing community needs.\n\n\"We're going out, we're doing these interviews and seeing what's lacking, where the gaps are,\u201d Lett said. \"The long-term goal is to address these gaps through building a coalition of leaders and champions and change makers in the Hampton Roads community surrounding opioid use, particularly with minorities.\"\n\nWinfield, an assistant professor of human services at Old Dominion who also serves as the Human Services Online Program Coordinator, said her role on the grant team is to produce needs-based assessments and presentations on all the current trends as it relates to opiate usage in Black communities.\n\nThe data they gather will be translated into a solution-focused understanding of what the numbers mean, tying needs to resources that are readily available but may not be widely known in the Black community, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really putting that research out there so other entities that maybe have a longer or deeper reach can do things like mobile clinics or other things that we can't do as a small research team,\u201d Winfield said.\n\nThey are looking to partner with community services support agencies, police departments, and pastors whom they hope will disseminate information.\n\n\"In the Black community, church is like a second home outside of the immediate family,\u201d Winfield said. \u201cThey will definitely listen to a pastor, a first lady or just the church itself because they trust the church.\u201d\n\nWinfield stressed the importance of providers involving the church and the family as part of a person\u2019s recovery journey.\n\n\u201cRecovery research supports longer success outcomes when there are support systems involved with that individual,\u201d she said.\n\nAt a very minimum, the investigators say they hope they can remove the veil between health providers and the Black community and lessen some of the stigma and mistrust surrounding opioid addiction and those seeking help to overcome it.\n\nLett said she is hopeful, even if the wins are incremental. \u201cHope comes from working in the field and seeing what little change can happen,\u201d she said. \u201cJust having a couple of people come to that treatment is significant in itself.\u201d",

        "text": "ZURICH \u2014 The lobby of this addiction clinic is unremarkable, really, except for the network of metal chutes and tubes that hug the walls as they snake downward from a pharmacy on the upper floors. Every few minutes, a new prescription comes clattering down, delivering a bottle full of powerful and effective pills used to treat opioid addiction to a waiting patient at the front desk. Sometimes, it\u2019s methadone. Other patients prefer slow-release morphine. In rare cases, for those at high risk of overdose or infectious disease, this clinic even prescribes pharmaceutical-grade heroin.\n\nThis scene is typical of a Monday afternoon in Switzerland. But in the United States, where opioid addiction medications remain controversial and highly stigmatized, it would be unthinkable. Just two medications are approved to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms in the U.S., and methadone, the more effective of the two, is kept under lock and key. Doctors cannot prescribe it except at specialized clinics. Pharmacies cannot dispense it. Instead, most patients seeking methadone treatment must attend their clinic each morning to receive a single dose.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut at Arud Centre for Addiction Medicine, a leading Swiss clinic, all patients in need of addiction care are given instant access to weeks\u2019 worth of medication. They are not required to participate in counseling, or subjected to drug tests, or punished if they relapse and use illicit substances. It is a strategy that many American methadone clinics warn would result in disaster \u2014 but that European experts say is the continent\u2019s key to success.\n\n\u201cWe have access to a very broad population because it\u2019s so easy to access our treatment center,\u201d Philip Bruggmann, a Swiss doctor and Arud\u2019s head of internal medicine, told STAT during a recent visit to the clinic\u2019s headquarters in central Zurich. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be possible in a system which is very restrictive, where people are getting kicked out of the program or disappearing because they can\u2019t comply with the regulations and rules. I think we would lose a lot of patients. They would die.\u201d\n\nInstead, the opioid death rate here is roughly one-twentieth the rate in the United States. The country has become a model for a highly effective, evidence-based policy response to a drug epidemic. And in roughly a dozen wealthy, developed nations where methadone is far more accessible than in the U.S., public health outcomes are far better. Residents of Germany, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands all can legally obtain methadone far more easily than in the United States. Each country has lower rates of opioid overdose, infectious disease transmission, and death.\n\nThe Swiss model serves as a noteworthy counterexample to the American system, where methadone and other medications used to treat opioid addiction are guarded by a maze of laws and regulations and typically viewed with skepticism or judgment.\n\nadvertisement\n\nShaken by the nation\u2019s jarring rate of opioid overdose deaths \u2014 over 80,000 per year \u2014 American doctors, lawmakers, and public health officials have begun to advocate for liberalizing access to methadone. Methadone, they argue, is the best tool available to address the crisis: Those who take it are 59% less likely to die of opioid overdose.\n\nAmerican methadone clinics, however, argue that the current restrictions are necessary safety precautions. Methadone is itself an opioid sometimes used to treat pain, and can cause sedation or even overdose when misused or taken in combination with alcohol and other drugs. The presence of fentanyl in the U.S. drug supply has made patient care even more complex and, according to some clinics, more dangerous. Prescribing opioid-based addiction medications more liberally, they argue, would result in increased overdoses, higher crime, and even cause people to become addicted to opioids after using methadone they obtained on the black market.\n\nAddiction experts in Europe disagree.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no evidence for it,\u201d Bruggmann said. \u201cIt really helps people to reintegrate, to stabilize, and I\u2019m not aware of a single case of a person who became opioid-dependent because of this treatment. If you leave it to the black market, people disappear and you can\u2019t reach them, and I think the risk is much bigger.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really free\u2019\n\nAndi H\u00fcttenmoser, 62, has seen firsthand how much access to addiction care has improved in Switzerland over the last three decades.\n\nOne of Arud\u2019s original patients, H\u00fcttenmoser has spent much of the last four decades on an up-and-down journey between drug use and recovery. In the mid-1980s, he was addicted to heroin, had been infected with hepatitis C, and was suffering from liver cirrhosis. But the clinic, and its policy of treating patients no matter their circumstance, helped him stabilize.\n\nH\u00fcttenmoser began by taking methadone, but later switched to slow-release morphine tablets because methadone made him sweat. In 2014, he also became one of the first hepatitis C patients in Switzerland to be fully cured using advanced new antivirals.\n\nHe has been sober, and hepatitis C-negative, since then. And for the last five years, H\u00fcttenmoser has worked as one of Arud\u2019s peer support coaches \u2014 serving, he said, as a \u201cbridge between the institution and the consumer.\u201d\n\nThe clinic\u2019s approach to addiction treatment, he said, makes recovery in Switzerland far easier than in the United States. Decisions at Arud are made after a conversation between a patient and doctor: By and large, patients have the power to choose whichever addiction medication they feel will work best for them.\n\nThose who choose methadone, slow-release morphine, or buprenorphine, another common drug used to treat opioid addiction, can receive up to 30 days of medication at once. Methadone is available in pill form \u2014 a significant difference from U.S. methadone clinics, which offer liquid medication, making it more difficult to take home or transport.\n\nThose receiving prescription heroin \u2014 a far smaller population \u2014 can receive the drug either in injectable or tablet form. The measure is only offered to patients whose drug use is most dangerous: Those at least 18 years of age who have suffered from opioid addiction for at least two years and have failed at least two attempts at treatment using more conventional medications. The clinic even offers a small room where people are permitted to inject the drug, formally known as diacetylmorphine, under medical supervision, though they\u2019re not permitted to inject drugs they bought on the black market.\n\nThough the approach may appear extreme, Swiss clinical trials have shown patients offered prescription heroin have high treatment retention rates, and many eventually transition to medications that don\u2019t induce the same euphoric effect, like methadone or slow-release morphine. Following Switzerland\u2019s success, countries including Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have also adopted the approach. And since the Covid-19 pandemic, many Swiss patients on heroin-assisted treatment have even been allowed to receive a week of take-home doses \u2014 meaning that prescription heroin in Switzerland is, in many cases, less tightly regulated than prescription methadone in the United States.\n\nWhile Arud strongly cautions against the continued use of illicit substances, it does not mandate drug testing as a condition of receiving medication. Nor, unlike many U.S. clinics, does it mandate counseling sessions: Each of the patients H\u00fcttenmoser helps independently chose to see a therapist or counselor.\n\nThe clinic also goes to great lengths to ensure that pregnant women with opioid addiction continue receiving medications like methadone \u2014 it would be \u201cvery dangerous\u201d for them not to, Bruggmann said. The policy is a stark contrast from typical practice in many U.S. health care settings, where providers and youth welfare agencies often force women to choose between keeping their baby and remaining in treatment using methadone or buprenorphine, even as doctors caution that cutting off medication treatment could lead to outcomes disastrous for both mother and child, like overdose or death.\n\n\u201cYou can get as much as you think you need,\u201d H\u00fcttenmoser said of the clinic\u2019s attitude toward medication. As a result, he added, Swiss addiction patients enjoy autonomy and quality of life that would be unimaginable across the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really free,\u201d he said. \u201cI can do what I want. I can go [for] two months in another country. It\u2019s no problem.\u201d\n\nThe same is true elsewhere on the continent. Countries across Europe prioritize patient convenience over strict regulation, said Honora Englander, an American physician currently studying access to addiction care while in France as part of a Fulbright scholarship. As a result, she said, patients generally find care simpler and easier, and as a result are far less likely to experience drug-related health issues like overdose, HIV, or hepatitis.\n\n\u201cThe work of being a patient in France is far less,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of traveling daily to [a methadone clinic], patients can \u2014 even relatively early in treatment \u2014 get several weeks of methadone at a time from their local community pharmacy. The bar to access treatment is so much lower, and it\u2019s not chaos. People are getting really good care.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s better to give them methadone\u2019\n\nMethadone treatment was once controversial in Switzerland, too. Three decades ago, the country experienced a reckoning on drug use not unlike the debate unfolding in the United States. At one point, the country\u2019s HIV transmission and AIDS death rates were the highest in Western Europe. Its overdose rate was three times higher than it is today.\n\nIn response, Swiss lawmakers took on an age-old debate: drug policy based on treatment, or drug policy based on law enforcement.\n\nIn the end, they chose a multipronged plan that placed a heavy emphasis on treatment and harm reduction \u2014 in particular, easy access to clinics that offered addiction medications like methadone and buprenorphine. In less than a decade, enrollment in methadone treatment climbed from zero to 18,000.\n\nAt the time, many viewed the approach as radical \u2014 especially in Switzerland, a generally conservative country where women only gained the right to vote in 1971. But many Swiss now see the move as obvious, and as an unmitigated success. Between the early 1990s and early 2000s, expanded access to medication and harm-reduction services like syringe exchange and supervised consumption sent rates of drug overdose, HIV, and hepatitis C plummeting.\n\nNowhere is the change more evident than at Platzspitz, a large city park just blocks from Arud that sits directly across from Zurich\u2019s bustling central train station. In the late 1980s, the station became a drug-dealing hub, and Platzspitz was such a haven for heroin use that it became known as \u201cNeedle Park.\u201d\n\nOn a sunny afternoon, park-goers played chess on Platzspitz\u2019s pristine grass, their bare feet making clear they no longer feared the stab of a stray syringe. The same is true across Switzerland: Low-barrier access to methadone, buprenorphine, slow-release morphine, and sometimes prescription heroin has helped wind down the country\u2019s drug epidemic, saving thousands from disease or death and all but eliminating visible drug use in public spaces.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSign up for Daily Recap\n\nAll the health and medical news you need today, in one email\n\nPlease enter a valid email address.\n\nSome debate remains about more aggressive tactics like prescription heroin and supervised consumption sites, but Switzerland\u2019s drug policy doctrine has not been seriously challenged since 1997, when 71% of voters rejected a referendum that would have significantly curtailed methadone treatment, syringe exchange, and supervised consumption rooms.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s experience has largely ended debate among Western and Central European public health experts regarding methadone access.\n\n\u201cIn all the European Union member states, methadone treatment is working quite well,\u201d Ingo Ilja Michels, a longtime drug policy official who has worked across Europe and Asia and served as the head of Germany\u2019s Office of the Federal Drug Commissioner, said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know any state in the world that has seen failure in this regard.\u201d\n\nGermany, too, was once restrictive with methadone, requiring that patients who enrolled in medication treatment programs pledge to be abstinent and enroll in counseling. Eventually, however, most policymakers there concluded that restricting the medication only to patients who were already stable was doing more harm than good.\n\n\u201cYes, of course it\u2019s better\u201d for patients to receive medication coupled with counseling and other support services, Michels said. \u201cBut it\u2019s better to give them methadone than nothing.\u201d\n\nRequiring patients to be fully abstinent and compliant with too many restrictions is \u201cnot realistic,\u201d he added. \u201cEven the right-wing politicians in the Bundestag now are saying: It\u2019s better to give them methadone than to ask them to stay abstinent.\u201d\n\nBut in the U.S., \u2018we don\u2019t have that\u2019\n\nFew American experts dispute Europe\u2019s relative success in combating drug addiction and helping people who use drugs to stay healthy.\n\nBut some defenders of the American approach to addiction treatment argue that other countries\u2019 situations are fundamentally different, and that policy solutions employed elsewhere would be either riskier or less effective if employed in the United States. They point out that some European countries offer cautionary tales, not success stories: In the United Kingdom, methadone deaths spiked in the 1990s, forcing the country to institute safeguards such as requiring some patients to take methadone daily at a community pharmacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to equate the experiences of other countries to our country,\u201d said Mark Parrino, the founder and president of the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, a national advocacy group that represents methadone clinics. \u201cThey have different backgrounds. They have different finances. Basically, the French government provides funding \u2014 all of it. We don\u2019t have that here.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. overdose crisis does have stark differences from past European drug epidemics. Most European nations have some form of universal health insurance, making issues of cost and payment for addiction care far simpler.\n\nIn North America, the illicit drug market is also dominated by fentanyl, the ultra-potent synthetic opioid that now causes a large majority of American overdose deaths. Fentanyl, to date, has not been detected in large quantities in Europe, meaning that opioid addiction there is typically easier to treat.\n\nAmerican addiction doctors, however, argue that the fentanyl epidemic gives all the more reason to expand methadone access. People using fentanyl are far more likely to die of an overdose from illicit substances, making the need to treat them with a comparatively weak, pharmaceutical-grade medication all the more urgent. Moreover, they argue, those addicted to fentanyl have developed extraordinarily high tolerances for opioids \u2014 meaning that any overdose risk associated with methadone treatment is negligible compared to the overdose risk of continued fentanyl use.\n\nTreatment and harm reduction are also far more unpopular among Americans than Europeans. In the U.S., tactics like supervised consumption and prescription heroin, while now commonplace in Switzerland, are political nonstarters. Even less controversial practices like syringe exchange or the use of test strips to check illicit drugs for fentanyl or xylazine \u2014 a veterinary sedative often known as \u201ctranq\u201d \u2014 still face political resistance in some U.S. cities and states.\n\nYet there is little evidence that Europe\u2019s flexible approach is having adverse public health effects.\n\n\u201cThere are stunning differences in terms of treatment access, and there are stunning differences in terms of overdose rates,\u201d Englander said, adding that patients in France \u201care getting their methadone from community pharmacies, and France is not seeing an epidemic of methadone overdose.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., attitudes appear to be shifting \u2014 at least among addiction doctors and policymakers. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and a coalition of Democratic and Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation that would allow trained addiction doctors to prescribe methadone, and pharmacies to dispense it.\n\nNora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, announced for the first time in 2022 that she believed physicians should be able to prescribe methadone directly to patients. More recently, she told STAT she believes that if the U.S. allowed universal access to methadone and buprenorphine, opioid deaths would fall by 50%, if not more.\n\nThe Biden administration has a stated goal of making addiction medication available to anyone who wants it by 2025, much as many European countries do now. But realizing that vision would require structural changes ranging from providing the medications in jails and prisons to vastly increasing reimbursement rates for doctors hoping to treat addiction.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change, however, would be one of attitude \u2014 and the channeling of compassion toward people who use drugs.\n\n\u201cIn America, you can\u2019t expect this,\u201d H\u00fcttenmoser said. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the street, you\u2019re on the street. Nobody cares. This is a big difference between the Americans and Swiss, or Europe.\u201d",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a nationwide settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family who own the company from civil lawsuits over the toll of opioids but also would have provided billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe decision also could affect other major bankruptcies, including the $2.4 billion bankruptcy plan for the Boy Scouts of America that has been approved by a federal judge, lawyers said.\n\nAfter deliberating more than six months, the justices in a 5-4 vote blocked an agreement hammered out with state and local governments and victims. The Sacklers would have contributed up to $6 billion and given up ownership of the company but retained billions more. The agreement provided that the company would emerge from bankruptcy as a different entity, with its profits used for treatment and prevention.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said \u201cnothing in present law authorizes the Sackler discharge.\u201d\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.\n\n\u201cOpioid victims and other future victims of mass torts will suffer greatly in the wake of today\u2019s unfortunate and destabilizing decision,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nThe high court had put the settlement on hold last summer, in response to objections from the Biden administration.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what happens next, though people involved in the case said they expect talks to resume. The members of the Sackler family branches who own Purdue suggested they\u2019ll return to negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate reality is that the alternative is costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cWhile we are confident that we would prevail in any future litigation given the profound misrepresentations about our families and the opioid crisis, we continue to believe that a swift negotiated agreement to provide billions of dollars for people and communities in need is the best way forward.\u201d\n\nEdward Neiger, a lawyer representing more than 60,000 overdose victims, called the decision a major setback.\n\n\u201cThe Purdue plan was a victim-centered plan that would provide billions of dollars to the states to be used exclusively to abate the opioid crisis and $750 million for victims of the crisis, so that they could begin to rebuild their lives,\u201d Neiger said in a statement. \u201cAs a result of the senseless three-year crusade by the government against the plan, thousands of people died of overdose, and today\u2019s decision will lead to more needless overdose deaths.\u201d\n\nAn opponent of the settlement praised the outcome.\n\nEd Bisch\u2019s 18-year-old son Eddie, died from an overdose after taking OxyContin in Philadelphia in 2001.\n\nThe older Bisch, who lives in New Jersey, has been speaking out against Purdue and Sackler family members ever since and is part of a relatively small but vocal group of victims and family members who opposed the settlement.\n\n\u201cThis is a step toward justice. It was outrageous what they were trying to get away with,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cThey have made a mockery of the justice system and then they tried to make a mockery of the bankruptcy system.\u201d\n\nHe said he would have accepted the deal if he thought it would have made a dent in the opioid crisis.\n\nHe\u2019s now calling on the Department of Justice to seek criminal charges against Sackler family members\n\nArguments in early December lasted nearly two hours in a packed courtroom as the justices seemed, by turns, unwilling to disrupt a carefully negotiated settlement and reluctant to reward the Sacklers.\n\nThe issue for the justices was whether the legal shield that bankruptcy provides can be extended to people such as the Sacklers, who have not declared bankruptcy themselves. Lower courts had issued conflicting decisions over that issue, which also has implications for other major product liability lawsuits settled through the bankruptcy system.\n\nThe U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department, argued that the bankruptcy law does not permit protecting the Sackler family from being sued. During the Trump administration, the government supported the settlement.\n\nThe Biden administration had argued to the court that negotiations could resume, and perhaps lead to a better deal, if the court were to stop the current agreement.\n\nProponents of the plan said third-party releases are sometimes necessary to forge an agreement, and federal law imposes no prohibition against them.\n\nBut the court majority that also included Justices Samuel Alito, Amy Coney Barrett, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Clarence Thomas disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe Sacklers seek greater relief than a bankruptcy discharge normally affords, for they hope to extinguish even claims for wrongful death and fraud, and they seek to do so without putting anything close to all their assets on the table,\u201d Gorsuch wrote. \u201cNor is what the Sacklers seek a traditional release, for they hope to have a court extinguish claims of opioid victims without their consent.\u201d\n\nCongress could write special rules for opioid-related bankruptcies, he wrote.\n\nAnd Kavanaugh, in dissent, urged lawmakers to do just that. \u201cOnly Congress can fix the chaos that will now ensue,\u201d he wrote.\n\nJason Amala, a lawyer representing more than 1,000 men who allege they were sexually abused as children by Boy Scout leaders and volunteers, said the decision could affect the Boy Scouts plan and others that employ similar releases from liability.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is pretty simple,\u201d Amala said in a statement. \u201cIf you hurt someone, you and your insurance company will have to pay fair value to settle their claim. If you want bankruptcy protection, you will have to file your own bankruptcy, disclose your assets and liabilities, and pay whatever amount a bankruptcy judge decides is appropriate.\u201d\n\nOxyContin first hit the market in 1996, and Purdue Pharma\u2019s aggressive marketing of it is often cited as a catalyst of the nationwide opioid epidemic, with doctors persuaded to prescribe painkillers with less regard for addiction dangers.\n\nThe drug and the Stamford, Connecticut-based company became synonymous with the crisis, even though the majority of pills being prescribed and used were generic drugs. Opioid-related overdose deaths have continued to climb, hitting 80,000 in recent years. Most of those are from fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.\n\nThe Purdue Pharma settlement would have ranked among the largest reached by drug companies, wholesalers and pharmacies to resolve epidemic-related lawsuits filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments and others. Those settlements have totaled more than $50 billion.\n\nBut the Purdue Pharma settlement would have been only the second so far to include direct payments to victims from a $750 million pool. Payouts would have ranged from about $3,500 to $48,000.\n\nSackler family members no longer are on the company\u2019s board, and they have not received payouts from it since before Purdue Pharma entered bankruptcy. In the decade before that, though, they were paid more than $10 billion, about half of which family members said went to pay taxes.\n\nThe case is Harrington v. Purdue Pharma, 22-859.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Chief Justice John Roberts was a dissenter, not Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this report.\n\n___",

        "text": "Medications to treat opioid use disorder, including methadone and buprenorphine, have been shown to save lives, cutting overdose deaths by up to 60% and reducing the transmission of HIV by offering a safe alternative to injection drug use. Many patients take these medications, which are called opioid agonist therapies, for years or even decades, and may be at risk of overdose if they lose access to treatment.\n\nIn Ukraine, which has the highest prevalence of HIV in Europe, war and the resulting disruptions to medical care have created a crisis for patients with drug use disorder and those who treat them.\n\nTwo years after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, a new study published in Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment examines how opioid treatment programs were interrupted by Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of the east of Ukraine and Crimea. Led by Anna Meteliuk, a research project manager at the Alliance for Public Health in Kyiv, Ukraine, and Danielle Ompad, vice dean for academic affairs and professor of epidemiology at the NYU School of Global Public Health, the study found that, despite efforts of local public health programs, only one-fifth of patients living in the areas occupied by Russia were successfully referred to drug treatment sites in non-conflict areas of Ukraine.\n\nThe researchers also looked at whether patients who transferred to other programs stayed in them long term. They found that less than half of the patients continued treatment through 2021, although those who received higher doses and more flexible methods of dosing were more likely to stick with their medications.\n\n\u201cWe know from the United Nations that dozens of people in Crimea died of overdoses in the first six months after the invasion because they no longer had access to treatment under Russia\u2019s restrictive drug laws. Our study provides further evidence of how challenging it has been to ensure access to life-saving opioid treatments in Ukraine,\u201d said Ompad, who is also the deputy director of the Center for Drug Use and HIV/HCV Research (CDUHR) at the NYU School of Global Public Health.\n\nCan you describe the need for drug treatment and harm reduction services in Ukraine?\n\nMeteliuk: Ukraine\u2019s high rate of HIV is mostly driven by injection drug use. We had a huge epidemic of opioid drug use in Ukraine after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Ukraine was in the middle of drug trafficking routes from Afghanistan to European countries, but lots of drugs stayed in the country, leading to a dramatic increase in opioids and injection drug use.\n\nBefore the 2014 conflict, the Donbas area\u2014which is the Donetsk and Luhansk regions\u2014and Crimea were responsible for almost one-third of all patients taking opioid agonist therapies in Ukraine. Those are highly drug-using regions because they border Russia, and at that time, most of the drugs we had in the country were coming from Russia. So those areas were responsible for a large share of opioid treatment patients in general.\n\nOmpad: There's a very strong harm reduction infrastructure throughout Ukraine. Organizations like Anna\u2019s, the Alliance for Public Health, provide HIV testing and other harm reduction supplies, including needle exchange and condoms. And they\u2019ve been working the whole time during the conflict. We cannot underestimate the dedication of public health workers and harm reduction specialists.\n\nWhat has been most disruptive for opioid treatment in Ukraine? Supply issues? The destruction of treatment sites? Displacement of residents?\n\nMeteliuk: It\u2019s all of those things, but the major way opioid treatment is disrupted is because Russia is occupying areas. There is no methadone in Russia\u2014opioid agonist therapies are prohibited. That\u2019s why, once they take over a town that has a treatment site, it gets closed right away because it\u2019s not allowed. If patients stay in that area, they may go back to street drugs or overdose and die. But if they leave for another part of Ukraine, they can be transferred to another treatment site.\n\nOmpad: When Russia invaded Ukraine for the first time and occupied Crimea, the Russian drug czar came on TV and said that they\u2019re going to get rid of opioid agonist therapies in Crimea. People were kicked off treatment almost immediately, and there were documented overdoses because they left people without the support they needed.\n\nWhat are your study\u2019s implications for the current conflict in Ukraine?\n\nMeteliuk: This study teaches us a lesson of how to act in the current situation. When Russia invaded us again in February 2022, they occupied the whole Luhansk region, so the opioid treatment program in Luhansk completely closed. Most of the sites in Donetsk and areas in Zaporizhzhia closed as well. Russia also took Kherson, but we got it back and reopened the treatment program. So once our army frees any territory, sites are being reopened.\n\nWe\u2019ve also had 17 sites ruined by shelling. But again, those of us at the front-lines, public health and the government and other non-government organizations, we are renovating and reopening sites. And if a site is destroyed, it doesn\u2019t mean that patients don\u2019t have anywhere to go; they are redirected to another site that is close to them.\n\nAfter the 2014 invasion, there was internal displacement, but after the full-scale invasion in 2022, many people moved abroad. The Alliance, together with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, created a list of opioid treatment sites in neighboring countries where people were potentially going\u2014Poland, Moldova, Romania, Germany\u2014and we contacted providers in those countries. This way, if someone came to his Ukrainian doctor saying, \u201cTomorrow, I'm going to Poland,\u201d for example, he will get his 15 day supply, and get all the documentation translated into English and the contact of where to go in Poland to get his medication. Once the person gets to Poland, he goes to that medical facility and gets the same dosing of methadone that he was taking in Ukrain\n\nHas the war forced any changes to substance use treatment that have improved access to care?\n\nMeteliuk: The war created a very strong network of what we call \u201cnarcologists,\u201d or drug treatment specialists. We have different chats and groups for exchanging information. For example, if a client from an occupied area is going to a non-occupied area, a doctor may call and say, \u201cThis person is going to be at your place in three days.\u201d They're being taken care of.\n\nThere\u2019s also more flexibility in take-home doses. It used to be that a person had to come to a site every day to receive medication. Then COVID started in 2020, and our government issued interim guidelines which allowed for a 15- to 30-day supply. It proved to be effective in certain cohorts of patients, like those who are stable, who are employed, who have families.\n\nOnce the war started, we were still using those guidelines, so the government allowed 30-day supplies, especially in very affected regions in the east and south. We\u2019ve now moved back to 7-day, 10-day, and 15-day supplies, depending on the patient. We are also piloting the use of telemedicine.\n\nOmpad: Something similar happened in the U.S. during COVID. SAMHSA [The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration] changed our guidelines to allow more take-home doses, as well as telemedicine. A lot of people are advocating for that flexibility to stay in the regulations.\n\nWhat questions remain unanswered about treatment during the current conflict?\n\nMeteliuk: Our next plan within this study is to see what happened to patients who are living with HIV, and whether their ART [antiretroviral therapy HIV treatment] was interrupted or not.\n\nOmpad: Something that I would like to know that is not easy to get at right now is what happened to the people who didn't re-enroll in treatment programs. How many of those people survived, and how did they survive? What happened with their opioid use? How many overdosed? How many were caught up in the conflict? It's a highly vulnerable community and it would be really important to understand these things so that we can figure out how to maintain continuity of care.",

        "text": "The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is allowing one of the nation\u2019s largest wholesale drug distributors to stay in business, reversing an earlier order stripping the company of its licenses for its failure to properly monitor the shipment of tens of millions of addictive painkillers blamed for fueling the opioid crisis.\n\nAs part of the settlement announced Wednesday, Morris & Dickson Co. agreed to admit wrongdoing, comply with heightened reporting requirements and surrender one of its two certificates of registration with the DEA. The Shreveport, La.-based company, which has around 600 employees and generates about $4 billion a year in revenue, also agreed to forfeit $19 million.\n\nLast May, DEA Administrator Anne Milgram revoked both of Morris & Dickson\u2019s licenses after an investigation by The Associated Press found the nation\u2019s fourth-largest drug distributor kept shipping drugs for nearly four years after a federal judge recommended the harshest penalty for its \u201ccavalier disregard\u201d of rules aimed at preventing opioid abuse.\n\n\u201cOf all the cases I handled as an administrative law judge for the DEA, Morris & Dickson\u2019s violations were the most blatant and egregious,\u201d Judge Charles Dorman told the AP. \u201cIn addition, I saw no real acceptance of responsibility for their violations.\u201d\n\nThe yearslong delay in issuing the order shined a light on Washington\u2019s revolving door after the AP reported that Milgram\u2019s handpicked deputy at the DEA, Louis Milione, was previously a consultant for Morris & Dickson, Purdue Pharma and other drugmakers blamed for the opioid epidemic.\n\nWATCH: Racial disparity in addiction treatment access highlights inequities of opioid epidemic\n\nLast summer, Milione resigned for the second time from the DEA and returned to Guidepost Solutions, a New York-based private investigative firm that has advised drug makers and distributors, including Morris & Dickson, in the past. Guidepost didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email asking whether Morris & Dickson remains a client.\n\nThe DEA last year acknowledged the time it took to issue its final decision was \u201clonger than typical for the agency\u201d but blamed Morris & Dickson in part for holding up the process by seeking delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its lengthy pursuit of a settlement.\n\nMorris & Dickson said Wednesday that it looks forward to future growth now that a case that threatened to put the 182-year-old company out of business had been resolved.\n\nIt said the settlement \u201crecognizes our extensive and voluntary efforts to improve and enhance our compliance system over the past five years,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, following our efforts, our state-of-the-art compliance program has been repeatedly acknowledged as impressive and above reproach by outside parties.\u201d\n\nThe DEA, in a news release, did not say why it disavowed its earlier order that Morris & Dickson cease operations. However, it once again faulted the company for turning a blind eye to thousands of unusually large orders for hydrocodone and oxycodone.\n\n\u201cToday, Morris & Dickson takes an important first step by admitting wrongdoing and paying for its misconduct, and today\u2019s settlement will ensure that such irresponsible practices will not continue in the future,\u201d said DEA spokesperson Katherine Pfaff.\n\nREAD MORE: How dozens of U.S. adolescents are dying of drug overdoses each month, shown in 3 charts\n\nNeither the DEA or Morris & Dickson immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nWhile Morris & Dickson has managed to stay open, several of the pharmacies it supplied have closed, had their licenses revoked by the DEA or have been criminally prosecuted.\n\nAmong the more than 12,000 suspicious orders that Judge Dorman said Morris & Dickson should have reported to the DEA were 51 unusually large orders of opioids made by Wilkinson Family Pharmacy in suburban New Orleans.\n\nWilkinson purchased more than 4.5 million pills of oxycodone and hydrocodone from Morris & Dickson between 2014 and 2017, and federal prosecutors say during that time owner Keith Wilkinson laundered more than $345,000 from illegal sales made with forged prescriptions or written by \u201cpill mill\u201d doctors. In May, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison.\n\nIn one month, as many as 42 percent of all prescriptions filled by Wilkinson were for painkillers and 38 percent of those were paid for in cash. The DEA considers a pharmacy\u2019s sales of controlled substances suspicious whenever they surpass 15 percent or cash transactions exceed 9 percent.\n\nYet Morris & Dickson never suspended any shipments to the pharmacy. Over three years, it filed just three suspicious order reports to the DEA \u2013 none of which resulted in shipments being suspended.\n\nGoodman reported from Miami, Mustian from New York.",

        "authors": [
            "Ron French"
        ],
        "text": "Rogers\u2019 home state wasn\u2019t spared, with 27,000 people dying from opioids since 2000, the equivalent of the city of Hamtramck becoming a cemetery. Since 2021, one Michigander has died every four hours from an opioid overdose.\n\nIn recent months, now campaigning as the Republican nominee for Michigan\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat, Rogers has talked about the opioid crisis, and the newer synthetic-opioid fentanyl surge, saying his background in the FBI makes him a good pick to fight the drug war.\n\nThis week, he criticized physicians for overprescribing the pills and a lack of enforcement by the federal government.\n\nRelated:\n\nDrug deaths drop in Michigan as task force weighs how to spend opioid funds\n\nSenate vote: Paths to victory for Rogers, Slotkin offer hope, peril in Michigan\n\nIn traveling RV, Michigan nurse tries to undo opioid damage she helped cause\n\nAbsent from his campaign, though, is acknowledgement of his record on opioid-related issues when he last served in Washington.\n\nA Bridge Michigan investigation revealed that while in Congress from 2001-2015, Rogers was a leading advocate for greater access to pain medications, which are typically variations of opioids. He received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from the same drug companies that now are paying billions of dollars in national opioid settlements for their roles in causing the epidemic.\n\nRogers was far from alone \u2014 there was a bipartisan, if minority, belief in Congress that doctors were under-prescribing pain medications, and other politicians received drug company contributions too. Yet Rogers\u2019 support of the drug industry was notable enough that he is referenced in at least one book about the opioid crisis, as well as multiple newspaper retrospectives of the epidemic. Rogers acknowledged in 2006 that drug companies considered him \u201ca champion\u201d of their industry.\n\nBridge on Monday asked the 61-year-old Rogers if he now wished he had taken a different approach to the opioid issue while in Congress.\n\n\u201cI understand that question is couched in a way that makes it sound terrible,\u201d Rogers said during an online press conference hosted by his campaign. \u201cI just disagree with the premise of the question.\u201d\n\nRogers recounted how his brother suffered from chronic pain from more than 30 back surgeries, and pain medications were needed to make his life bearable until he died at age 60.\n\n\u201cWithout that relief, the last 10 years of his life would have been, well, candidly, we wouldn't have had him for that last 10 years of his life,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cEvery single day (he was) in intense pain where it was disabling for him to work (or) to pick up his kids.\n\n\u201cWhat we were doing (in Congress) is making sure that true chronic pain sufferers had access to drugs that would at least give some relief and hopefully allow them to spend some time with their family,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThere are a whole bunch of chronic pain sufferers out there that were going to get whacked around because people weren't paying attention (to their pain).\u201d\n\nWhat lessons can be learned from the action \u2013 or inaction \u2013 of Congress 20 years ago matters to the tens of thousands of Michigan families who\u2019ve been torn apart by opioid addiction. And experts say Rogers, who wants to be Michigan\u2019s next U.S. senator, could have done more in his role to temper the growing epidemic.\n\n\u201cCongress was asleep at the wheel,\u201d said Jonathan Stoltman, director of the Michigan-based Opioid Policy Institute, which tracks opioid settlement fund spending. \u201cMike Rogers contributed to the crisis.\u201d\n\nOpioid deaths skyrocket\n\nBridge has published more than three dozen articles this year chronicling the opioid epidemic and critical decisions Michigan leaders must make about how to use $1.6 billion in lawsuit settlement funds from pharmacies, manufacturers and distributors deemed partly responsible for the crisis.\n\nMany of the people now in recovery who shared their stories with Bridge first became addicted through opioid prescriptions.\n\nFor example, Jolene Fassett\u2019s descent into addiction began with an opioid prescription for pain given to her in 2004, when she was 18. \u201cIt was the time when they were pushing them (opioids),\u201d she told Bridge in July.\n\nOpioid prescriptions skyrocketed in the 2000s, when drug companies made a concerted effort to make pain elimination a medical priority. By 2011, opioids were the most commonly prescribed drug in America, more than antibiotics and high-cholesterol medications.\n\nSome of those prescriptions led to addictions. For example, 45 percent of those who use heroin began with prescription opioids, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nDuring that decade, Rogers was one of Congress\u2019 leading advocates for increased access to pain care. In an examination of bill proposals, news releases, legislative updates, campaign finance records and articles written at the time, Bridge found:\n\nRogers introduced the National Pain Care Policy Act in 2003, and again in 2005, and was co-sponsor of the same act in other years. Rogers\u2019 bills and those he co-sponsored included a range of mandates, from developing a pain care initiative for veterans, to assuring Medicare and Tricare (the health care plan for active-duty military) covered pain meds. It also would permit the federal government to offer grants to educate doctors on pain and palliative care. The bills did not include penalties for over-prescribing.\n\nThough it was early in the epidemic, addiction issues connected to new drugs like Oxycontin were no secret. The first lawsuit against opioid manufacturers was filed in 2000 in West Virginia, and the U.S. General Accounting Office released a report on oxycontin abuse in 2003, the year Rogers introduced his first pain bill.\n\nAccording to an investigation by the Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity, Rogers campaign and leadership accounts received at least $310,000 in contributions from groups tied to the pharmaceutical industry between 2006-2015. Rogers explained the donations in 2016 by saying that, \u201cI think they said, \u2018This guy is a champion, he\u2019s doing something we believe in and we want to support a guy like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nRogers received $226,000 in donations from companies that are now paying Michigan and other states in settlements over their roles in the opioid crisis, including Johnson & Johnson, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson. You can see the totals here and here.\n\nHe received $162,000 from seven opioid distributors that supplied 83 percent of all prescription opioids to Michigan between 2006 and 2019, according to a Washington Post report.\n\nIn television ads promoting his general election opponent, U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, Democrats have criticized Rogers for past campaign contributions by the pharmaceutical industry, but those ads have not noted his advocacy for increased opioid prescriptions.\n\nIn written answers to additional questions from Bridge, Rogers drew a distinction between \u201cpain management doctors who were treating chronic pain sufferers\u201d and \u201can over-prescribing medical community.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference, and it was a very underserved and misunderstood need in the medical community,\u201d Rogers said.\n\n\u2018A lot of blame to go around\u2019\n\nWhile Rogers was one of the biggest advocates of increased access to pain meds while he was in Congress, only one bill increasing access that he sponsored, co-sponsored or voted for was signed into law. The Veterans Pain Care Act of 2008 mandated that the Department of Veterans Affairs create a comprehensive pain care policy. The bill had broad bipartisan support, and was introduced by Democrat Tim Walz, a congressman from Minnesota who is now the party\u2019s vice presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cThere are things the federal government could have done differently, but \u2026 a lot of us can say that. We were all doing what we thought was right.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dr. Chad Brummett\n\nRogers\u2019 pain bills over the years also drew some bipartisan support, including from Michigan Democrat John Dingell, who suffered from chronic pain.\n\nIn 2015, the same year Rogers left Congress, Dingell\u2019s congressional seat was taken over by his wife, Debbie Dingell, who has been outspoken in her efforts to strike a balance with opioid policymaking.\n\n\u201cI have lived all sides of the opioid epidemic,\u201d she wrote in a news release in 2018, one year before her husband passed away. \u201cMy father was addicted to opioids before anyone really knew what they were, and my sister died of a drug overdose. Yet my husband lives with chronic pain and needs opioids to live comfortably. We cannot let the pendulum swing too far in either direction.\u201d\n\nThe line between prescribing too much of a potentially addictive drug and prescribing so little that it increases suffering is a tightrope doctors and policymakers continue to walk.\n\n\u201cI think there's a lot of blame to go around\u201d for the opioid crisis, said Dr. Chad Brummett, co-director of the Opioid Research Institute and Overdose Prevention Engagement Network at the University of Michigan.\n\nWhile he doesn\u2019t hold Congress or federal agencies blameless, Brummett said physician practices also played a role in the crisis. He said it used to be common for doctors, including himself, to write prescriptions for more pills than were medically necessary to make sure patients \u201cdon\u2019t run out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were told, if you had real pain, you couldn't become addicted,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s now known that is untrue.\n\nSome of those prescriptions led to substance use disorder, Brummett acknowledges.\n\n\u201cThere are things the federal government could have done differently, but I think a lot of us can say that,\u201d Brummett said. \u201cWe were all doing what we thought was right.\u201d\n\nBut in Rogers\u2019 responses to Bridge, the former congressman declined to say whether Congress played a role in the crisis, putting the onus only on doctors and the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nIn a response from Rogers after this story first published, he said drug companies also share blame for the crisis.\n\nWhen asked if he agreed that increased opioid prescriptions in the 2000s, which his bills urged, played a role in increased addictions, Rogers said: \u201cThe data clearly shows that doctors who were over prescribing were causing addiction in patients, but not all doctors, and certainly not all patients.\n\n\u201cClearly the DEA needed to provide stronger enforcement on the \u2018pill mills\u2019 that created this huge problem,\u201d Rogers said. \u201dDoctors abusing their ability to prescribe and lack of appropriate enforcement by the federal government are to blame.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress could have (said), \u2018Let\u2019s pause this mass prescribing and look at the effect of these drugs, which isn\u2019t panning out in the long-term. We\u2019re not seeing quality of life improved. We\u2019re seeing dependency,\u2019\u201d McGreal said. \u201cBut Pharma said, \u2018Don\u2019t let the addicts take away (medications) from people in pain who need these drugs.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the opportunity (to curb the crisis) was lost.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Rogers said it\u2019s \u201ccritically important for patients who are suffering from disabling and debilitating chronic pain that we get it right. When doctors are found to be abusing their prescribing authority, they should be dealt with and held accountable.\u201d\n\nWith tenfold more people dying of opioid overdoses in Michigan than in the year 2000, McGreal doubts that lessons have been learned.\n\n\u201cObviously there is a place for these drugs, they will be prescribed,\u201d McGreal said. \u201cBut America is the only country that prescribes them in this way (so frequently).\n\n\u201cMy sense is this whole thing could happen again.\u201d",

        "text": "Nick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nWelcome back to the Nature Podcast, this week: why fentanyl is so addictive...\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\n\u2026and why babies are suing the government of South Korea. I\u2019m Lizzie Gibney.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nAnd I'm Nick Petri\u0107 Howe.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nOpioids, like fentanyl, are behind tens of thousands of deaths every year in the US alone, and that is in large part down to their very addictive nature. The drugs have two main effects on the brain that contribute to this: one, they make you feel good \u2014 they reward you for taking them, and two, if you stop taking them you feel bad \u2014 you get withdrawal.\n\nAnd whilst these two effects are known to drive addiction, the underlying neuronal mechanism is unclear. And that\u2019s a problem, because whilst these drugs have great potential to do harm, they are also incredibly useful for pain relief. A better understanding of what\u2019s going on in the brain could allow scientists to design drugs that are less addictive, whilst still keeping their benefits.\n\nAnd that is precisely what Christian L\u00fcscher from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, and his collaborators, have done - in mice - using the particularly potent drug, fentanyl. Here\u2019s Christian.\n\nChristian L\u00fcscher\n\nSo far, when you look in the textbook, the explanation that is usually given is that opioids very strongly activates the dopamine system. And when they do so for some time, weeks, or even months, and then all of a sudden, they're not available, that system is sort of exhausted. And then you have a situation where you have not enough dopamine. And that would explain why people have this aversive state and they feel down. Now our work looked into this and we needed to do this in mice, because only there we can actually do all these molecular manipulations. And the first observation we made, which was very surprising is when you take out the protein, the receptor that is responsible for that positive reinforcement, in the reward system, the withdrawal is still normal. So there is there's still dependence and when the animal no longer has access to an opioid, they will show all the signs of withdrawal syndrome. So the\u2013 the explanation that it is the same system that causes the positive reinforcement, as well as the negative reinforcement didn't seem to hold. And so that was the beginning of our study.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nSo rather than there just being this one system that does both these things, there seem to be two different systems that do this sort of like withdrawal part and this reward pathway. How did you identify what was going on in these two different pathways?\n\nChristian L\u00fcscher\n\nSo we put the mice in situation where they will go into withdrawal. And we looked in many, many different brain regions, which ones were active. You can do this by monitoring a gene a so called immediate early gene that reflects the neuronal activity. And we had then a few candidate areas where something really interesting is going on during withdrawal, one of which was the central amygdala. And that's why we focused our attention then on this particular part of the brain.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nAnd what is the central amygdala normally involved in?\n\nChristian L\u00fcscher\n\nSo it's involved in fear responses, in anxiety. And so it's, of course, the brain regions that people know very well. What we have been able to contribute with this, that we identified the population of cells that express the receptor for the opiates, it's called the \u00b5-opioid receptor. And that was unknown until then how exactly these cells are located in the central amygdala. And that is how we were able to identify that it is actually those cells, which are the entry gate if you will, of this negative reinforcement for opiates.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nAnd this is in contrast to the other one that's doing the more sort of positive reward side.\n\nChristian L\u00fcscher\n\nSure. So, then we now change from a model where one system would be responsible for both the positive and the negative reinforcement to a system where you would have two distinct circuits that mediate one and the other.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nAnd not only the identify these neurons and their relative locations in the brain, but you also manipulated them to show that there was a very causal mechanism going on here.\n\nChristian L\u00fcscher\n\nThat's the beauty of current modern circuit neuroscience. You cannot observe what happens in the cells but then you have actually tools to manipulate and these are largely optogenetic tools. That is, you can manipulate those cells by putting in ion channels that are light sensitive and you can either activate or inhibit the cells. And so, I guess the crucial experiment that really indicates causality was when we were able to put an opsin into these cells of the central amygdala, that activates those cells, and we made them active continuously. And we showed that this is very similar to the aversive state that the animal feels in opiate withdrawal. And so the animal then was given the opportunity to press a lever to pause this activation, and that they learned very quickly. So, this is precisely the definition of negative reinforcement, you do an action to alleviate an aversive state. And what's more, this mechanism is then also sensitive to the injection of fentanyl. So, we could block this behaviour by exposing the animal a little bit to fentanyl.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nSo, what do you think this means for our sort of understanding of opioids and addiction, that there are these two pathways?\n\nChristian L\u00fcscher\n\nSo for first, it's a gain in knowledge we better understand and now we can focus on the cellular mechanism and the molecular mechanisms. So it is conceivable that we then design drugs that would activate one or not the other. So, this is in the larger picture of trying to parse the relevant circuits that mediate specific symptoms of opiates. So for cor\u2013 for the opiates, the\u2013 the effect that we usually look for is to use them as painkillers. So, to reduce the pain that's yet in a different brain area but it is now important to see that we have additional two mechanisms that are involved and not one. And that will sort of give us new ideas on how to do selective new compounds that would basically do pain, to reduce the pain but not induce addiction. And it could also help us to better design substitution therapies, which is the cornerstone of opioid use disorder treatment. When people suffer from that they usually receive methadone, or in some countries, even heroin as a substitution drug. And now that we know how heroin and methadone activates these both circuits, we can improve those substitution therapies.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nAnd you know, you mentioned a couple of different opioids there. This study was about fentanyl, so do you think this sort of mechanism is broadly applicable to opioids?\n\nChristian L\u00fcscher\n\nYou're right, we need to formally test this. But from all we know, it's the exact same receptors that is activated, because when you take out the new receptors, all effects of the opiates are gone. And so, by extension, we are confident that this applies not only to fentanyl, but also to other opiates. The reason why we chose fentanyl is because it is a drug of public concern. But it is also a very rapidly active drug and that helps us to parse the effects. The faster a drug, the easier it is to see under experimental conditions.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nAnd you know, this study was in mice, what do you think needs to be done to translate this to humans?\n\nChristian L\u00fcscher\n\nWell, we know that these receptors and these brain circuits also exists in humans, and we can image them with functional technologies such as functional MRI, and I think our clinical colleagues now can use our sort of blueprint of what one has to look for, to confirm or not whether the same mechanisms apply to human people with addiction.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nThat was Christian L\u00fcscher, from the University of Geneva, in Switzerland. For more on that story, including a link to Christian\u2019s latest paper, published in Nature, check out the show notes.\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nComing up, why babies are taking the South Korean government to court. Right now, though, it\u2019s time for the Research Highlights, with Dan Fox.\n\n<music>\n\nDan Fox\n\nThe model of the blood-brain barrier made by combining two organoids could transform how scientists studied drug delivery to the brain. Organoids are groups of lab-grown cells that together form structures resembling an organ. By combining organoids, researchers can make \u2018assembloids\u2019 allowing them to study complex biological systems. In this case, a team wanted to learn more about the blood-brain barrier, the layer of cells that regulates which chemicals can pass from the bloodstream into the brain. To replicate the barrier, they combined blood vessel organoids with brain organoids. The blood vessels grew into the brain tissue creating networks of capillaries, and the team found that the same types of cell were present in the same places in both the \u2018assembloid\u2019 and the human blood-brain barrier. The researchers also created models using stem cells from people with a genetic disorder that causes the blood-brain barrier to fail. These yielded \u2018assembloids\u2019 that replicated the donors\u2019 disease. Read that research in full in Cell Stem Cell.\n\n<music>\n\nDan Fox\n\nAn edible gel based on milk protein can both prevent and treat alcohol intoxication in mice. Harmful alcohol consumption leads to millions of deaths each year. And while treatments exist for severe intoxication, many of them need to be injected directly into a vein and provide only temporary relief from symptoms. Now, researchers have developed an alternative, by combining single iron atoms with nanometre-scale threads of a milk protein that is a by-product of cheesemaking. The team found that the gel could reduce alcohol levels in the blood of intoxicated mice and even prevent mice from becoming intoxicated in the first place. They say that their approach has potential for human use in a clinical setting. If you want to read that paper, you can find it in Nature Nanotechnology.\n\n<music>\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nFinally on the show, it\u2019s time for the Briefing Chat where we discuss a couple of articles that have been featured in the Nature Briefing. Nick, what have you been reading about this time?\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nWell, I've been reading about how babies are suing the South Korean government. And this was a story I was reading in Nature.\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nI'm so intrigued by this.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nWell, I should say it's not literally the babies taking the government to court is their parents using them as the plaintiff in this particular case. And it's about climate change. So, you've probably heard the various different climate change cases against governments for not doing their part or not doing enough in the view of those people to tackle climate change. And the idea is that for these younger folk it\u2019s their futures that are being ruined. So, it may have a bit more of an effect on the government to say like, hey, you know, you're infringing on our human rights by not doing enough.\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nAnd is this somewhat unprecedented? Have babies taken people to court before?\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nSo, children across the world have actually taken governments to court. I think babies is quite unusual and, in this case, there's actually an unborn child as well who's one of the plaintiffs involved, obviously, again, it's the parents it's not literally the unborn child. But the idea, like I say, is that tackling climate change should protect future generations, and it's their\u2013 and it's their futures that will be affected if we don't do enough against climate change.\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nYeah, it makes sense. What are the South Korean government doing or not doing that, you know, these families, including the babies want to happen?\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nSo currently, the South Korean government's targets are to reduce their emissions by 40% below their 2018 levels by 2030. Which sounds like a lot but if every country did that, that would still commit us to three degrees of warming by the end of the century. And you know, that's beyond the sort of limits that were agreed at Paris. And so, the argument here is that is insufficient, so they want to see more action. And this is done at a particular time as well, because this year, the Korean government will have to present their revised climate targets to the United Nations. And so, the people involved in this case, hope it will convince the government to, you know, be a bit more ambitious for the next 2035 target.\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nSo, is this mostly a, you know, a public relations thing to get support for these kinds of changes to their targets? Or, you know, in the actual case, is there some kind of potential outcome that sees the government having to what I guess give a huge payout or something? Like what legally could happen if the families win?\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nSo, if there was a constitutional ruling that the South Korean government's targets were insufficient, they would have to enhance their climate ambition. So, there could be a very direct\u2013\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\n\u2013it could force their hand to do something\u2013\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\n\u2013basically force their hand. And this has been seen, like across the world, as I said, like there have been other such cases, like in Switzerland, there was a famous one where similar things occurred. But the interesting thing about this one, as well, is this is the first case of its kind in East Asia \u2014 this really hasn't been done there. And the people involved are really hopeful that this will provoke more of these kinds of litigations against governments in East Asia, because really, we need everyone in the world involved. But in the past, in East Asia, people have seen litigation as a last resort, and this may make them reconsider how they use litigation.\n\nLizzy Gibney\n\nWe often think of with climate change, you know, there not been much we can do as an individual, but I guess this is one of the things you can do is sue your government.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nNo, exactly, and the people involved in this case are quite optimistic as well. They say even if they lose this case, it's provoking a conversation is provoking social awareness and it could start change happening more and more.\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nShall we talk about my story next?\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nYeah, let's do it. What have you been reading this week?\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nWell, it's literally my own story. Little bit cheeky. I bought my own story, so it's obviously by me in Nature. And this is about a new kind of nuclear power source, a heater based on the radioactive decay of an element called americium, which is actually a by-product of nuclear waste. And that's going on the European Space Agency's ExoMars mission, and Europe has never had its own one of these before. And no one's ever made one of these kind of nuclear heaters out of this particular element, americium, before either, so it's\u2013 it's a double first.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nYeah, a lot of firsts going on here. But I guess, first of all, what is this heater going to be used for? Literally just heating the spacecraft? Or is there something more?\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nThat right. So, it can get very, very cold in space, and to operate all kinds of components you need a heater. And this is very, very long lasting. That's the beauty of these radioactive decay-kind of heaters. So as the americium decays, it just releases heat. And in this case, it's actually going to be warming things within the landing platform. So, you have the kind of mothership that gets you out there to Mars, and then you have the lander comes out of that and lands and then that turns into a landing platform, that then ejects the rover out onto the surface. So that's the Rosalind Franklin rover. So there are going to be some similar kind of heaters made by NASA on the rover, but the ones made by Europe, these new pioneering ones are going to be on the landing platform itself. So it says slightly complimentary, it's not\u2013 it's not\u2013 it's not the big guns, they haven't put them yet on the rover, which is where they'd be really, really, really important. But they\u2019re still doing an important job there on this landing platform. So they're keeping the landing platform going for much longer than it probably would do otherwise.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nAnd why would you need to have the landing platform I guess, sort of heated up? Mars is pretty cold, I gather, but what is the advantage?\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nExactly, so it is cold there, so it will be going to Mars with its own batteries that only lasts a certain amount of time. This will keep the batteries warm and that means that the lander will have power for longer. So if there's a problem, say or there's some issue with unfurling the landing platform and getting the rover out, the rover derives all its power from the landing platform before it's deployed on the surface, and it gets out of solar panels. So this will mean basically that anything that goes wrong with the rover exiting out onto the surface, we have a little bit more of a window to save the mission. So it could turn out to be really important.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nAnd are there extra considerations they need to make sort of sending nuclear material into space? I mean, space missions are quite dangerous, at the best of time.\n\nLizzie Gibney\n\nHugely. So until now only NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian Space Agency have made these kinds of nuclear-powered heaters, and similar batteries. So, ESA is not quite ready to do the battery-kind where you turn the heat into electricity, but it's getting there as well. But so far, it's always been NASA or Russia. And they have made theirs from plutonium and they have supplied everyone else. So, in previous years, previous ESA missions, they've just use American or Russian heaters and batteries. What happened here with ExoMars, of course, is it was a collaboration with Russia. And then following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that partnership was severed. And so, ESA has had to go back to the drawing board on a lot of fronts and figure out how to make this mission work. So, this is one tiny glimmer of opportunity in there and that they've said, okay, you know, what we're gonna do, we don't have the Russian heaters anymore, we're gonna use our own new pioneering type.\n\nNow, I realised I\u2019ve gone off your question which was about how difficult is to make these and that is to say that very, very difficult, so they've only had plutonium ones up until now. And they require a huge amount of safety checks and certification before you can fly them. Obviously, what you're doing is effectively putting something radioactive on the top of a massive rocket, which is just another kind of fancy word for a bomb, really, and shooting it up into space. Okay, so they have to be really, really well encased so that they could withstand almost anything happening during launch. So those processes are going on right now. There's been some research teams that have been working on this since about 2009 on, you know there are so many different stages, how do we get this the americium, how do we get it? Well, it comes from nuclear waste, but can you take it out nuclear waste, and convert it into little kind of fuel pellets? You know, how do you do that? Then how do you build a device around it, because it's a lot, you get a lot less power for your gramme than you do with plutonium, which is what they've used till now. So, you need to just redesign the whole thing around that you need a bigger volume. So, they've been doing that. And then now we're in the kind of final stages, which is making sure it's all really safe. And so, this is going to launch in 2028. So, it feels like a long way off but I think it's gonna go in the blink of an eye, isn't it. So, they've probably got a lot of work to do.\n\nNick Petri\u0107 Howe\n\nWell, hopefully we can come back in four years and see where it's at, then and hopefully all goes well for them. But I think that's all we've got time for on the Briefing Chat today.

Maria Stoker provided a moving speech about the death of her son, Thomas O'Neill Jr., who died on July 12, 2023, from a fentanyl overdose. Matthew Sager, who has been sober for eight years and two months, shared his recovery journey from the Men\u2019s Halfway House at New Hope. Shannon Baruti, a Morris County resident, recounted how addiction has profoundly impacted her life and the lives of many loved ones she has lost to overdose.\n\nBehind the chairs where participants and families of victims were seated stood the \"Drug Epidemic Memorial Wall,\" a poster depicting hundreds of faces of New Jersey residents who have died from drug overdoses.\n\n\u201cThese faces behind us should not just be a painful reminder of what we\u2019ve lost; they should also motivate us to prevent the same agony from happening to others. Overdose deaths are irreversible, leading to generations of brokenness and devastation for families,\u201d said Commissioner Director Christine Myers, who was joined by Commissioner Thomas Mastrangelo at the ceremony. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything we need to impart to our youth, it\u2019s the understanding that they matter most.\u201d\n\nSheriff James M. Gannon, who delivered welcome remarks after a prayer led by Rev. Herman Scott, chaplain of the Morris County Correctional Facility, emphasized the importance of continued vigilance and community support in addressing the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cOnly action\u2014not lip service or dates on a calendar\u2014will reduce the number of people dying from overdoses and the number of people trying opioids and heroin for a thrill or to ease the pain, only to become addicted,\u201d said Sheriff Gannon. \u201cWe are a county that takes action, that gets out into neighborhoods and offers solutions. We don\u2019t leave people to suffer alone. We can defeat opioid abuse, and we can and do provide emotional support to those who feel overwhelmed or in despair.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff noted that there have been 33 suspected fatal overdoses in Morris County this year, a 48% reduction compared to the same period last year. Drug overdoses have been steadily declining in the county since 2017, with the exception of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe county\u2019s success in addressing the opioid crisis can be attributed to numerous programs and partnerships among various departments, agencies, and 69 service providers throughout the county, including the Sheriff\u2019s Office Re-Entry Program, Community Connections, the Hope One mobile unit, Hope Hub, Navigating Hope (a mobile outreach initiative provided by the Morris County Department of Human Services and Family Promise of Morris County), the Morris County Mental Health Association, and the Morris County Overdose Fatality Review Team.\n\nNarcan administration has also contributed to the reduction in fatalities. To date, the Hope One team has trained 10,053 people in how to administer Narcan, and 160 Narcan kits have been returned, signifying lives saved by someone using Narcan they received from Hope One.\n\nProsecutor Robert J. Carroll spoke about the ongoing challenges law enforcement and emergency providers face due to the increasing prevalence of inexpensive, synthetic opioids like fentanyl and xylazine.\n\n\u201cFentanyl is currently the only drug being cut with xylazine, an animal tranquilizer that is resistant to Narcan\u2026 A kilogram of fentanyl costs a fraction of what heroin does, so it\u2019s dominating the deadly market. Today, 97 percent of the heroin being seized contains fentanyl\u2014in some cases, it\u2019s pure fentanyl,\u201d said Prosecutor Carroll.\n\nThe prosecutor noted that since 1999, more than one million people in the United States have died from drug overdoses. While overdose deaths may be trending downward in New Jersey, drug-related fatalities remain a significant issue. Since 2014, Morris County has lost 639 people to overdoses, with fentanyl continuing to be the primary cause.\n\nThe event concluded with a remembrance of loved ones lost to the drug epidemic, led by Carol Egan, founder of the Global Recovery Movement and former chair of the Morristown and Morris Township Municipal Alliance. She invited Kathleen Hyland, former Morris Township mayor, and families of the victims to join her at the front.\n\nHyland and Egan are pioneers in the fight against the opioid crisis and substance abuse. They began meeting with Morristown citizens 35 years ago to develop drug and alcohol prevention programs in schools and communities. Their efforts resulted in the first Municipal Alliance in New Jersey in 1990, which fostered relationships with community leaders and offered life-changing opportunities for teens in need of substance abuse interventions and counseling.\n\nAs the ceremony concluded, Rev. Herman Scott offered a closing prayer, bringing the community together in a moment of reflection and hope.\n\nIn 2020, Sen. Anthony Bucco introduced legislation that was signed by the governor to recognize every Aug. 31 as Overdose Awareness Day. The Morris County Board of County Commissioners joined this observance through a resolution adopted on July 8, 2020. The annual ceremony serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggle against addiction and the need for continued action and support within the community.\n\n###\n\nPhotos\n\nPhoto 1: (l-r) Shannon Baruti, (a mother who lost her son to overdose), Maria Stoker (who lost her son, Tommy, to overdose in 2023), Kathleen Hyland, Carol Egan, (a mother who lost her son to overdose), (a family member to an overdose victim), Rebecca Finnerty (who lost her son Justin to overdose in 2016), Sheriff James Gannon, Commissioner Director Christine Myers, Mackensie Fosko of the Morris County Division of Behavioral and Community, Morris County Division of Behavioral and Community Health Director Amy Archer, Morris County Human Services Director Kasey Errico, Prosecutor Robert Carroll, Commissioner Thomas Mastrangelo and Undersheriff Mark Spitzer of the Morris County Sheriff\u2019s Office.

        "text": "BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Evelyn Jefferson walks deep into a forest dotted with the tents of unhoused Lummi Nation tribal members and calls out names. When someone appears, she and a nurse hand out the opioid overdose reversal medication naloxone.\n\nJefferson, a tribal member herself, knows how critical these kits are: Just five months ago, her own son died of an overdose from a synthetic opioid that\u2019s about 100 times more potent than fentanyl. The 37-year-old\u2019s death was the fourth related to opioids in four days on the reservation.\n\n\u201cIt took us eight days to bury him because we had to wait in line, because there were so many funerals in front of his,\u201d said Jefferson, crisis outreach supervisor for Lummi Nation. \u201cFentanyl has really taken a generation from this tribe.\u201d\n\nA bill before the Washington Legislature would bring more state funding to tribes like Lummi that are trying to keep opioids from taking the next generation too. The state Senate unanimously approved a bill this week that is expected to provide nearly $8 million total each year for the 29 federally recognized tribes in Washington, funds drawn in part from a roughly half-billion-dollar settlement between the state and major opioid distributors.\n\nThe approach comes as Native Americans and Alaska Natives in Washington die of opioid overdoses at five times the state average, according to 2021-2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that includes provisional numbers. The rate in Washington is one of the highest in the U.S. and more than three times the rate nationwide \u2014 but many of the state\u2019s Indigenous nations lack the funding or medical resources to fully address it.\n\nLummi Nation, like many tribes, faces an additional challenge when it comes to keeping outside drug dealers off their land: A complicated jurisdictional maze means tribal police often can\u2019t arrest non-tribal members on the reservation.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do when we have a non-Lummi, predatory drug dealer on our reservation with fentanyl, driving around or on their property and are selling drugs?\u201d said Anthony Hillaire, tribal chairman.\n\nAgainst the backdrop, tribes such as the Lummi Nation, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of Seattle, say the proposed funding \u2014 while appreciated \u2014 would barely scratch the surface. The tribe of about 5,300 people on the shores of the Salish Sea has already suffered nearly one overdose death a week this year.\n\nLummi Nation needs $12 million to fully finance a 16-bed, secure medical detox facility that incorporates the tribe\u2019s culture, Hillaire said, and money to construct a new counseling center after damage from flooding. Those costs alone far exceed the annual total that would be designated for tribes under the legislation. The Senate has proposed allotting $12 million in its capital budget to the facility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a sovereign nation. We\u2019re a self-governed tribe. We want to take care of ourselves because we know how to take care of ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we usually just need funding and law changes \u2014 good policies.\u201d\n\nThe proposed measure would earmark funds deposited into an opioid settlement account, which includes money from the state\u2019s $518 million settlement in 2022 with the nation\u2019s three largest opioid distributors, for tribes battling addiction. Tribes are expected to receive $7.75 million or 20% of the funds deposited into the account the previous fiscal year \u2014 whichever is greater \u2014 annually.\n\nRepublican state Sen. John Braun, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, has said he envisions the funds being distributed through a grant program.\n\n\u201cIf this ends up being the wrong amount of money or we\u2019re distributing it inequitably, I\u2019m happy to deal with this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just going to get us started, and make sure we\u2019re not sitting on our hands, waiting for the problem to solve itself.\u201d\n\nOpioid overdose deaths for Native Americans and Alaska Natives have increased dramatically in the past few years in Washington, with at least 100 in 2022 \u2014 75 more than in 2019, according to the most recent numbers available from the Washington State Department of Health.\n\nIn September, Lummi Nation declared a state of emergency over fentanyl, adding drug-sniffing dogs and checkpoints, while revoking bail for drug-related charges.\n\nThe tribe has also opened a seven-bed facility to help members with withdrawal and get them on medication for opioid use disorder, while providing access to a neighboring cultural room where they work with cedar and sage. In its first five months, the facility treated 63 people, the majority of whom are still on the medication regimen today, said Dr. Jesse Davis, medical director of the Lummi Healing Spirit Opioid Treatment program.\n\nBut truly thwarting this crisis must go beyond just Lummi Nation working on its own, said Nickolaus Lewis, Lummi councilmember.\n\n\u201cWe can do everything in our power to protect our people. But if they go out into Bellingham, they go out anywhere off the reservation, what good is it going to do if they have different laws and different policies, different barriers?\u201d he said.\n\nThe tribe has urged Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and President Joe Biden to declare states of emergency in response to the opioid crisis to create a bigger safety net and drive additional vital resources to the problem.\n\nIn the encampment in Bellingham, Jefferson estimates there are more than 60 tribal members, some she recognizes as her son\u2019s friends, while others are Lummi elders. She suspects many of them left the reservation to avoid the tribe\u2019s crackdown on opioids.\n\nWhen she visits them, her van filled with food, hand warmers and clothing to hand out, she wears the shirt her niece gave her the day after her son died. It reads, \u201cfight fentanyl like a mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a losing battle but, you know, somebody\u2019s got to be there to let them know \u2014 those addicts \u2014 that somebody cares,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cMaybe that one person will come to treatment because you\u2019re there to care.\u201d",

Even though the United States saw a 3 percent decline in overdose deaths overall during this period, deaths in Washington state increased by more than 21 percent, continuing trends which began during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLarsen\u2019s Four-Pillar Approach to Combating the Opioid Epidemic\n\nLarsen\u2019s report outlines a comprehensive, four-pillar framework centered around prevention, interdiction, treatment and recovery to tackle the ongoing crisis:\n\nPreventing individuals from turning to opioids;\n\nInterdicting the flow of opioids into communities;\n\nExpanding treatment; and\n\nSupporting long-term recovery for individuals and building resiliency in local communities.\n\nIn addition to the several federal policy recommendations listed in his report, Larsen plans to soon introduce legislation aimed at creating a dedicated funding source for multijurisdictional drug task forces and helping communities that have been economically dislocated by the opioid epidemic recover.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nTo read Larsen\u2019s district opioid report, click here.\n\nTo read Larsen\u2019s op-ed featured in Cascadia Daily News, click here.\n\n###",

        "text": "In his darkest moments, Jason Hall felt worthless. During his childhood and early adulthood, he said, there were times when he would drink too much alcohol, pop pills at nightclubs and, inevitably, do something or say something that would hurt people he loved.\n\nHall, 41, would never have thought that his life journey would take him from those dark experiences to potentially saving lives with his work refilling naloxone vending machines across Oklahoma.\n\nOver-the-counter naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, is an inhaled medication used to reverse an opioid overdose while it\u2019s happening. Naloxone vending machines \u2013 which provide the medications for free \u2013 can help people access doses quickly and reduce someone\u2019s risk of dying from an opioid overdose since, ideally, the medication should be given immediately.\n\nThe vending machines also offer free fentanyl test strips, small strips of paper that can test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that drives most overdose deaths in the United States.\n\nFrom California to New York, vending machines stocked with harm-reduction tools have been placed in areas where high numbers of opioid overdoses have been reported.\n\nIn Oklahoma, some of the machines are located along turnpikes, in casinos, on university campuses, at a library or outside fire stations.\n\nA CNN analysis of state health departments finds that at least 33 states and the District of Columbia have naloxone vending machines. In some states, like Oregon, city or county health departments or local nonprofits might operate the machines without state involvement. Other states, like Delaware, don\u2019t currently have vending machines but plan to launch programs this year.\n\nThe size of these programs can vary. Oklahoma plans to expand its program this year from 27 machines to 40. Other large programs can be found in places like Michigan, where Wayne County officials announced last month plans to deploy 100 vending machines containing naloxone.\n\nWhen working with the vending machines in Oklahoma, Hall often reflects on his experiences to inform his work. As a senior field representative for harm reduction campaigns at the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, he leads community training sessions on harm reduction as well as helping restock dozens of naloxone vending machines for people to access anonymously.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s reasons for using substances are as vast and different as there are different types of suffering. I grew up as a queer kid in a small town, and it was not a super cool thing to be in the \u201880s and \u201890s,\u201d said Hall, who is based in Oklahoma City. \u201cYou\u2019re basically told from a very, very young age that this is kind of the worst thing that you can be. You internalize that, and it creates a lot of depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nHall, who is now sober, said that at a young age, he turned to substances like methamphetamines or opioids to give him the feeling of confidence he craved at the time. In his mid-30s, Hall sought treatment for substance use disorder.\n\n\u201cThis followed me my entire life. Then I got to a place where I wasn\u2019t using methamphetamines and opioids, and alcohol was my substance of choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a very cool hipster guy. I was vegan, and I only rode a bicycle around. It\u2019s funny that I was very particular about the foods that I would eat, but as far as substances, I wasn\u2019t so picky.\u201d\n\nHall, who works for the state and occasionally bartends on the side, said he has personally administered naloxone several times to reverse opioid overdoses during his time bartending and while working in shelter and housing programs.\n\nEven though he knows that naloxone is accessible through the vending machines, he always keeps some on him too, just in case.\n\n\u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to need these products. A lot of times, substance use isn\u2019t planned,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, people are out in the community and maybe having a few cocktails and a substance becomes available, and maybe it\u2019s a substance you typically wouldn\u2019t use, but you\u2019ve had a couple drinks, and your inhibitions are lowered.\u201d\n\n\u2018People are dying every minute of the day\u2019\n\nMore than 111,000 people in the US died from a drug overdose in the 12-month period that ended in September, according to provisional data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about overdose death rates, I\u2019ve got any number of friends, I see their face every time I see those numbers or when we talk about the number of overdose reversals that come from kits that are distributed by our community partners,\u201d Hall said.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear those numbers, I hear the voices of my friends that are currently struggling with substance use disorder,\u201d he said, eyes filling with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s very real to me.\u201d\n\nOverall, the number of overdose deaths associated with any drug continues to increase each month in the United States, although the pace appears to be slowing. Deaths reached a record high in May and changed little in the following months, through September.\n\n\u201cPeople are dying every minute of the day due to these overdoses, and so the vending machines are an amazing tool to help get the help into the hands of the public,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n\u201cThis is a prevention technique, and it\u2019s very, very helpful to have these distribution points in the community that allow people to get what they need quickly without necessarily relying immediately on a first responder when seconds matter to save a life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so these distribution points and these vending access machines are meant to bring the solutions closer to the community and put the tools in their hands to save lives.\u201d\n\nA study conducted in Cincinnati found that a single vending machine was directly associated with reversing overdoses for at least 78 people in its first year.\n\nIn Clark County, Nevada, another study found that in the 12 months after the launch of naloxone vending machines, there were 229 opioid-involved overdose deaths. But researchers had previously predicted that there would be about 270 deaths in the county, suggesting that about 41 deaths were averted after the machines were launched.\n\nMachines need to be restocked every day\n\nOklahoma\u2019s naloxone vending machine program launched in June. The state placed its first machine at a homeless shelter in Tulsa.\n\nThe machines have become so popular that they need to be restocked every day, said Heath Hayes, former deputy commissioner for the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.\n\n\u201cAll of the vending machines have technology associated with it that ping us when they\u2019re getting low. So if they\u2019re at 50% capacity, we get the staff ready to activate the restockers,\u201d Hayes said.\n\n\u201cThese vending machines that we have active right now have about 11,000 boxes of naloxone that have been distributed,\u201d he said, and each box contains two doses.\n\nThe vending machines each hold 100 naloxone kits and 54 fentanyl test strip packages. Both items \u2013 naloxone and the test strips \u2013 are available in the machines free of charge. Typically, an over-the-counter box of two single-dose naloxone sprays can cost around $45.\n\nIn 2022, before the launch of the vending machine program, about 700 people died of opioid overdose in Oklahoma, according to state health department numbers, up from about 400 deaths in 2021. Hayes said the state will closely watch those numbers to see whether they decline over time, especially as naloxone becomes more easily accessible with the addition of more vending machines.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to get naloxone in the hands of every Oklahoman, because we want to normalize that naloxone is something that every person should carry on them,\u201d Hayes said before he left the department.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate goal is to have naloxone in 2 million-plus people\u2019s hands that are 18 and older,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are overdosing can\u2019t use this medication on themselves, and for about 40% of the people who overdose, there\u2019s a bystander around. So it\u2019s critical that you have naloxone on you, because you never know when you can save a life.\u201d\n\nAside from providing naloxone and fentanyl test strips at no cost, an appeal of the vending machines is that they offer a sense of anonymity. The machines do not collect any identifiable information, and anyone can walk up and use them.\n\nHayes said there is still a lot of stigma around opioid use and the need for naloxone, but he hopes the vending machines can help reduce it. The machines have large print on the sides that reads \u201cnaloxone saves lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot often do you see a vending machine that says \u2018Naloxone can save lives\u2019 and it be very mental health- and addiction-focused, at your gas station,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThat\u2019s another piece to this, is that we have a physical symbol of anti-stigma in places that typically aren\u2019t associated with the mental health field.\u201d\n\nSome critics question whether the machines enable dangerous behaviors. Naloxone vending machine programs often can face opposition from the communities where they are placed. But public health advocates champion the machines as a way to reduce the number of lives lost to overdose while reducing stigma.\n\nIn central Pennsylvania, six naloxone vending machines have been installed in rural communities where stigma can be prevalent but there is a greater need for expanded access to naloxone medication, said Carla Sofronski, executive director and co-founder of the Pennsylvania Harm Reduction Network.\n\n\u201cHarm reduction is often highly stigmatized, especially in Pennsylvania, with the thought process that it is enabling drug use, when it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. Harm reduction does not condone drug use. It just provides life-saving interventions and tools in a toolbox to keep people alive and minimize risk,\u201d Sofronski said.\n\n\u201cWe have to start treating this as an urgent public health crisis, and folks should not be denied access to life-saving interventions due to stigma or because some folks may believe that people have addiction due to moral failure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to cut the stigma to actually get these tools out to people.\u201d\n\n\u2018You are not a broken person\u2019\n\nHall has faced stigma firsthand. He says he has heard some criticisms or \u201cdifficult\u201d questions about the naloxone vending machines and other programs. For instance, people might ask whether the vending machines enable opioid abuse on-site.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to think that somebody\u2019s going to walk into one of these spaces and see that this vending machine has fentanyl test strips and Narcan and think, \u2018oh, this makes it safe for me to use.\u2019 I think if anything, it\u2019s bringing more to the forefront the danger around using these substances,\u201d Hall said.\n\n\u201cIt really is a shame that, a lot of times, we have to spend our time and energy into humanizing people that use substances or people that might need access to these tools,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some people that have the attitude of \u2018well, if somebody overdoses, then that\u2019s their problem,\u2019 and that\u2019s really unfortunate.\u201d\n\nSome of these negative biases and attitudes around people with substance use disorders remind Hall of how easily stigma can chip away at someone\u2019s self-worth.\n\nIf he could speak to his younger self, at the peak of his substance use, he would tell himself that he is worthy of all that life has to offer.\n\n\u201cI would tell little baby Jason that everything is going to be OK,\u201d Hall said.\n\n\u201cYou are not a broken person, and you are not less than anybody else, and you are not less deserving of everything that life has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these things about yourself that you think make yourself so different and so \u2018othered\u2019 really just make you so much more human.\u201d",

Families in small towns, large cities, Tribal lands, and every community in between are affected, no matter who they are, what they look like, or how much money they make. That\u2019s why President Biden named beating the opioid and overdose crisis a key pillar of his Unity Agenda during his first State of the Union Address.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s Unity Agenda focuses on issues on which all Americans can come together and make progress for the Nation. The Biden-Harris Administration has worked to strengthen not only the whole-of-government response, but also the whole-of-society response to address this public health and public safety crisis head-on.\n\nThe White House Challenge to Save Lives from Overdose is a nationwide call-to-action to stakeholders across all sectors to commit to save lives by increasing training on and access to life-saving opioid overdose reversal medications.\n\nAn overdose can happen anywhere, to anyone. That\u2019s why the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments and taken historic action to expand access to opioid overdose reversal medications. But we need stakeholders in every community across the country to help ensure preventable deaths are avoided. Organizations and businesses\u2014big or small, public or private\u2014should be ready to help keep their employees, customers, and communities safe.\n\nTo help more Americans save lives, we are encouraging leaders to commit to train employees on opioid overdose reversal medications, keep the medications in first aid kits, and distribute medications to employees and customers so they might save a life at home, work, or in their communities.\n\nTogether we can save lives and beat the overdose crisis. Join us.\n\nLearn about the Challenge\n\nThe White House Challenge to Save Lives from Overdose is a nationwide call-to-action to stakeholders across all sectors to commit to save lives by increasing training on and access to life-saving opioid overdose reversal medications.\n\nTo help more Americans save lives, we are encouraging leaders to commit to train employees on opioid overdose reversal medications, keep the medications in first aid kits, and distribute medications to employees and customers so they might save a life at home, work, or in their communities.\n\nEveryone can do their part to beat the opioid and overdose crisis. We welcome commitments from organizations, philanthropists, local governments, and businesses\u2014big or small and across all industries and expertise. Industries with employees at higher risk of overdose, likely to witness an overdose, or engaging high numbers of Americans may especially benefit from participating.\n\nThe Challenge\u2019s fact sheet details actions that organizations and businesses are taking to save lives from overdose. You can make a commitment to:\n\nTrain 100% of your employees on how and when to use an opioid overdose reversal medication\n\nEnsure an opioid overdose reversal medication is in every first aid kit at your worksites or schools\n\nPurchase and distribute opioid overdose reversal medication to a certain number of your employees and/or customers\n\nWe encourage you to think and act boldly. Consider commitments that:\n\nYou can sustain until we beat the overdose crisis\n\nWill help support individuals and communities most impacted by fatal overdoses\n\nReplicate models that are already working in your industry\n\nTest new models that could be replicated by others\n\nExpand on what the federal government can do\n\nThank you for signing up to make a difference. See the White House Guide to Saving Lives from Overdose for more information on responding to an overdose, training employees, and purchasing opioid overdose reversal medications.\n\nLearn about opioids and overdose\n\nOpioids are a type of drug used for pain relief and include prescription medications, such as oxycodone, and illicit drugs, such as heroin and illicitly-made fentanyl. Some opioids such as buprenorphine and methadone are used to treat opioid use disorder.\n\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and can be used medically to treat severe pain. However, it is also illicitly manufactured and sold through illegal drug markets. It may be sold as fentanyl, show up in other drugs to make them more potent, or be an unintentional contaminant.\n\nSome pills that look like commonly misused prescriptions are fake pills that contain potentially fatal amounts of illicit fentanyl.\n\nNote: The White House does not endorse any nonfederal entity, product, service, or publication.

Contact the external site for answers to questions regarding its content.\n\nThe overdose crisis impacts all Americans nationwide.\n\nEmergency medical service providers respond to overdoses, administer opioid overdose reversal medications, and save lives daily. Find data about your state and county through the Nonfatal Drug Overdose Surveillance Dashboard.\n\nOpioids can cause someone\u2019s breathing to slow down or stop. Opioid overdose reversal medications block opioids\u2019 effects, restore breathing, and often save lives. There are currently two FDA-approved opioid overdose reversal medications: naloxone and nalmefene.\n\nThere are many forms of opioid overdose reversal medications, including nasal sprays and injectable products, and they come in a variety of doses. All are effective in reversing opioid overdose, including from fentanyl.\n\nOpioid overdose reversal medications are available in all 50 states. Certain medications are available over-the-counter on retail pharmacy shelves, while others require a prescription from your doctor or can be obtained under a standing order from your local pharmacy.\n\nConsider asking your local health department or a harm reduction organization for free opioid overdose reversal medications.\n\nSAMHSA recommends that opioid overdose reversal medication be administered anytime someone is experiencing signs of opioid overdose, such as weak or no breathing, small pupils, and cold or clammy skin. Opioid overdose reversal medications can save the life of someone experiencing an opioid overdose and are not harmful to someone who is not experiencing an overdose.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with your state\u2019s Good Samaritan laws.\n\nFor more information on how to identify and respond to overdose, see SAMHSA\u2019s Overdose Prevention and Response Toolkit.\n\nThe National Safety Council has resources ready for employers that want to support their employees.\n\nBiden-Harris Administration Actions\n\nFor the first time ever, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved naloxone, a life-saving opioid overdose reversal medication, for non-prescription, over-the-counter purchase at grocery stores and pharmacies nationwide. In addition, the FDA is making it easier for harm reduction organizations to obtain naloxone directly from manufacturers and distributors to increase the public\u2019s access to this lifesaving medicine.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has invested historic amounts of funding in the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant program to make opioid overdose reversal medications available at no cost to residents of states and Tribes. Using SOR funds, states and Tribes have purchased nearly 10 million opioid overdose reversal medication kits and helped to reverse more than 600,000 overdoses. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is supporting states and Tribes with technical assistance, policy academies, and convenings to ensure SOR funds are used to help saturate hard-hit communities with opioid overdose reversal medications.\n\nThe Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), in collaboration with the Ad Council, launched a social media campaign, Real Deal on Fentanyl, to reach young people with critical messaging about the dangers of fentanyl and the life-saving effect of opioid overdose reversal medications. Its Spanish-language companion site, La Realidad sobre el Fentanilo, launched in March 2024.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offers the Overdose Prevention and Response Toolkit, which provides updated guidance on preventing overdoses and responding to opioid- or stimulant-involved overdoses, and offers population-specific guidance to people who use drugs, people who take prescription opioids, first responders, healthcare practitioners, and other audiences. This builds on many bold actions that HHS has taken to beat the overdose crisis, including updated federal regulations for opioid treatment programs to expand access to treatment for the first time in two decades, and the announcement that HHS grant funds may now be used to purchase xylazine test strips, where permitted by law.\n\nEvidence-based harm reduction services, including the distribution of opioid overdose reversal medications, save lives. In President Biden\u2019s FY2024 budget request, he called for an additional $100 million for harm reduction services\u2014funding that will help distribute more opioid overdose reversal medications.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the General Services Administration (GSA) issued new guidance that encourages all federal facilities to include life-saving opioid overdose reversal medications in their safety stations for use during overdose emergencies.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) called on public health departments and health care systems to collaborate with housing providers, community development organizations, and other housing agencies to help expand access to opioid overdose reversal medications in the communities they serve. Housing providers play a critical role in ensuring that all public spaces have life-saving medications available and that more people are prepared to use the medications during emergencies.\n\nThe White House and the Department of Education called on schools, colleges, and universities to have opioid overdose reversal medications on-site and ensure that students and employees are prepared to use these medications to save a life on or near their campuses.\n\nTake Action & Tell your story\n\nTake Action\n\nTell Your Story\n\nStay Connected\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail Address* Required\n\nZIP Code\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nFentanyl and other opioids are fueling the worst drug crisis in the history of the United States. More than 1,500 Americans per week die from taking some type of opioid, making the drug by far the leading cause of fatal overdoses in the country. In recent years, the crisis has become defined by illicit fentanyl, an extremely lethal synthetic opioid. Illegal fentanyl supplies are largely produced in China and Mexico and then smuggled into the United States.\n\nMore From Our Experts\n\nAnalysts say the opioid epidemic started with the overprescription of legal pain medications in the 1990s, but it has intensified in recent years due to influxes of cheap heroin, fentanyl, and other synthetic opioids supplied by foreign drug cartels. The crisis has become a scourge on the economy, a threat to national security, and a major foreign policy challenge.\n\nWhat drugs are contributing to the crisis?\n\nMore on:\n\nPublic Health Threats and Pandemics\n\nDrug Policy\n\nOpioids\n\nUnited States\n\nNational Security\n\nOpioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy plant, can be divided into two broad categories: legally manufactured medications and illicit narcotics. Opioid medications, including oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, and fentanyl, are often prescribed to treat severe pain, while methadone is primarily used in addiction treatment centers.\n\nThe opioid crisis has been characterized by three distinct waves. The 1990s saw growth in overdose deaths from opioid-based medications, such as Percocet and Oxycontin, as physicians increasingly prescribed them for chronic conditions despite concerns about their safety and effectiveness. This period was followed by the rise of illegal heroin that marked a brief second wave in the early 2010s. And most recently, synthetic opioids\u2014fentanyl in particular\u2014have been driving a dramatic spike in overdose deaths since around 2013.\n\nFentanyl was legally manufactured and prescribed [PDF] as an intravenous anesthetic beginning in the 1960s. While it remains an important drug in health-care settings, its illegal manufacture and distribution has become an extraordinary threat to public health. In 2022, the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Anne Milgram, said that \u201cfentanyl is the single deadliest drug threat our nation has ever encountered.\u201d\n\nMore From Our Experts\n\nNew combinations of synthetic opioids continue to crop up as well, complicating the crisis. Xylazine, a powerful chemical used in horse tranquilizers, and other novel opioids are reported to have far higher potency than pure fentanyl.\n\nWhat is the scale of the epidemic?\n\nOverdoses involving synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, are the leading cause of U.S. deaths in people ages eighteen to forty-five. In 2021, the overall death toll surged to 80,411, more than ten times the number of U.S. military service members killed in the post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. A study by researchers at the Mayo Clinic and Yale University found that deaths from fentanyl alone nearly tripled from 2016 to 2021.\n\nMore on:\n\nPublic Health Threats and Pandemics\n\nDrug Policy\n\nOpioids\n\nUnited States\n\nNational Security\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic worsened the opioid epidemic. Disruptions to supply chains forced people to turn to drugs they were less familiar with, and social-distancing measures led more people to take drugs alone, which brings a greater risk of overdosing, analysts say.\n\nAlong with the pandemic, the growing availability of illicit fentanyl, often disguised by drug cartels to appear as legal prescription opioids, has exacerbated the crisis. In 2022, the DEA seized more than fifty million fentanyl-laced, fake prescription pills, more than double the amount seized the prior year. Over half of these fake pills contained potentially lethal amounts of fentanyl, the DEA says.\n\nFentanyl\u2019s extreme potency also makes the drug more addictive and more deadly, further fueling the crisis. A lethal dose requires just two milligrams of the drug\u2014an amount roughly equivalent to ten to fifteen grains of table salt.\n\nWhat are the demographics of the opioid crisis?\n\nFentanyl\u2019s deadly toll affects a broad swath of the American public. Among U.S. drug overdose deaths in 2021, fentanyl was the top killer [PDF] for all regions of the country and all age, race, and ethnic groups. Still, it hit some harder than others\u2014American Indian and Alaska Native people, Black people, younger adults, and men died from fentanyl-linked overdoses at higher rates.\n\nAnother concerning trend is the rise of fentanyl deaths in youths between ten and nineteen years old. Fatal fentanyl overdoses nearly doubled in teens between 2019 to 2021. Experts attribute some of this rise to the ease of purchasing counterfeit pills through social media.\n\nResearch has also shown that other demographic groups, including military veterans, people with disabilities, those who have lost a spouse, renters, and those without health insurance, have been disproportionately harmed by opioids.\n\nWhat are the economic consequences?\n\nThe opioid epidemic is taking a heavy toll on the U.S. economy, according to many reports. One of the most staggering and widely cited estimates, by the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee (JEC), found that the opioid epidemic cost the United States nearly $1.5 trillion in 2020, or 7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) that year, an increase of about one-third since the cost was last measured in 2017. The JEC projected this increase would continue given the rise in fatal overdoses. This massive sum includes the price of health care to treat overdoses, the costs of fighting fentanyl trafficking and pursuing criminal justice efforts, and lost productivity in the workforce, as well as the economic costs of human lives lost to overdose and the reduced value of life for overdose survivors.\n\nWhere are the heroin and fentanyl coming from?\n\nMost fentanyl in the United States is smuggled across the border with Mexico, U.S. officials say. Smugglers send it across in vehicles or with pedestrians, who can travel with small, easily concealable amounts of the drugs because of its high potency compared to other illicit narcotics. The median weight seized is just 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds), which contains more than fifty thousand lethal doses. By December 2023, at least 12,245 kilograms (27,000 pounds) had been intercepted at the southern U.S. border this year.\n\nChina was the dominant source of fentanyl coming into the United States, but the flow has significantly decreased since authorities banned production of all fentanyl variants in 2019. However, China is still the leading manufacturer of fentanyl ingredients, known as precursor chemicals. Most of the fentanyl smuggled into the United States from Mexico is made from chemicals from China.\n\nMexican drug cartels are the leaders in fentanyl production. Two organizations, the Sinaloa Cartel, and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, manage most of the production and distribution networks, often depending on American citizens to smuggle fentanyl across the border. Between 2017 and 2021, 86 percent of fentanyl traffickers were American citizens.\n\nIn October 2023, the Sinaloa Cartel looked to publicly signal that it was moving away from fentanyl trafficking amid an intensifying crackdown on its operations by U.S. and Mexican authorities. As one of two major suppliers, this would be a significant shift, but it remains unclear how genuine or effective Sinaloa\u2019s transition will be.\n\nWhat is the United States doing to combat the opioid crisis?\n\nFor decades, the U.S. government has worked with several other countries, particularly Mexico, to restrict the flow of illegal narcotics entering the country. For instance, through the M\u00e9rida Initiative [PDF], the United States provided Mexico with some $3.5 billion in security and counternarcotics aid between 2008 and 2021, including for purchases of military aircraft and surveillance software. (Under Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mexico has broadly resisted cooperation with the United States on the issue, claiming that it does not produce fentanyl.) However, the sharp rise in fentanyl-related deaths in recent years has raised alarm in Washington, with lawmakers calling for a dramatic shift in U.S. drug policy.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has made the fentanyl crisis a domestic and foreign policy priority, although the death toll from fentanyl overdoses has continued to climb during his time in office. In late 2021, he declared synthetic-opioid trafficking a national emergency and signed two executive orders allowing his administration to sanction individuals and entities associated with the production and dissemination of fentanyl. In late 2023, the U.S. government sanctioned twenty-five China-based firms and individuals it believed to be involved in producing fentanyl precursor chemicals. And Biden added China to the U.S. list of major illicit drug-producing and drug-transit countries, where it joins twenty-two others, including Colombia, India, and Mexico.\n\nAmid these efforts, the Biden administration has kept up pressure on Mexico to intercept precursors received from China and to crack down on clandestine labs in its own country. And in November 2023, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, President Biden reached separate agreements with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mexican President L\u00f3pez Obrador to increase bilateral cooperation on the preventing manufacturing and distribution of illicit fentanyl.\n\nAt the same time, the Biden administration is attempting to curb illicit opioid distribution domestically. Federal regulators have introduced new limits on opioid prescriptions and increased focus on seizing fentanyl and raising public awareness of the drug\u2019s lethality. In 2022, the DEA seized double the amount of fentanyl compared to the prior year, and it released a public alert about fake prescription drugs laced with fentanyl\u2014six out of ten fake pills contain a lethal dose of the drug.\n\nTo ameliorate the drug\u2019s harm, in March 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the naloxone nasal spray Narcan as the first over-the-counter drug to reverse fentanyl overdoses. Experts say the public sale of Narcan, which became available in many chain pharmacies beginning in September, marks a significant step forward in efforts to combat the epidemic, but it is not a panacea due to cost and accessibility challenges.",

        "text": "The news cycle has moved on, but the scars of the opioid crisis remain etched deep in communities across California. Take a stroll down nearly any street in Sacramento, and you will see the human impact firsthand. This ongoing tragedy isn\u2019t a natural disaster but a man-made one, fueled by a few power-driven pharmaceutical companies and influential consulting agencies that prioritized profit over lives. The resulting deaths are not just statistics; they represent lives cut short, dreams unfulfilled, and loved ones left in unimaginable pain.\n\nThe betrayal of our veterans is a particularly dark chapter in this story. Veterans, who have served our nation with honor, have found themselves victims of an opioid epidemic exacerbated by unscrupulous corporate practices. Pharmaceutical giants aggressively marketed opioids, downplaying their addictive potential and incentivizing doctors to overprescribe. These actions were calculated, driven by profit at the expense of human lives.\n\nThe role of consulting firms in this crisis cannot be overlooked. McKinsey & Company, for example, worked simultaneously for Purdue Pharma and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Investigative reporting has disclosed that McKinsey is under investigation for potentially exacerbating the opioid pandemic. They advised Purdue on increasing sales while encouraging opioid prescriptions for veterans. This strategy victimized our veterans to boost opioid sales. Few policymakers have shown true courage on this topic, with California Assemblyman Devon Mathis being a notable exception. He has publicly shared his concerns with McKinsey\u2019s past work with Purdue Pharma.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t anyone with regulatory or governmental authority question this relationship? The public deserves to know the nature of McKinsey\u2019s consulting work and how potential conflicts were managed. Ignoring the role these companies played won\u2019t bring back lives or erase the trauma experienced by families. However, it would send a chilling message that corporate greed can go unchecked.\n\nThe cost of ignoring the culpability of these companies is too high. Allowing these faceless corporations to fade into the background is not only an injustice to the victims but also a dangerous precedent that could perpetuate future public health tragedies. Bad actors and their collaborating partners need to be held accountable for the human loss caused by their selfish quest to increase sales and profit.\n\nAs the founder of Arrive Alive CA, I call on Congress to take decisive action. The opioid crisis among senior veterans is a call to action. We need transparency, accountability, and justice for those who have suffered. We owe it to our veterans, to the families torn apart by this crisis, and to future generations to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.\n\nOne vital step in addressing this issue is the introduction of the Alternatives to Opioids (ALTO) in the VA Emergency Act, or the Alternatives to PAIN Act. This legislation promotes non-opioid pain management treatments within the VA healthcare system. By providing veterans with safer alternatives for pain management, we can reduce the risk of addiction and improve their overall quality of life. This Act represents a crucial move towards a more compassionate and responsible approach to pain management for our veterans.\n\nIt\u2019s time to demand accountability from those who have prioritized profit over human lives. It\u2019s time to protect our veterans and ensure they receive the care and respect they deserve. We must hold those responsible for this crisis accountable and prevent future public health disasters driven by corporate greed.",

        "text": "Addiction used to be considered a lack of willpower that could be overcome with sufficient effort and restraint.

These changes can persist long after a person stops using these substances, increasing risk for relapse.\n\nAddiction to opioids \u2014 prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl \u2014 is a national crisis. The epidemic\u2019s impact has been vast, disproportionately affecting military personnel and veterans, and estimates put the annual U.S. economic burden for prescription opioid misuse alone at more than $504 billion. NIH-supported research has led to effective strategies that can be implemented right now to save lives and to prevent and treat opioid addiction. For example, NARCAN\u00ae Nasal Spray can revive individuals from opioid overdose. NIH is working with other federal agencies and the pharmaceutical industry to develop new medications and technologies to prevent and treat opioid addiction.\n\nA tandem issue to tackling opioid dependency is finding safe, effective, non-addictive strategies to manage chronic pain.
