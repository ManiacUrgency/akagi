    "definition": "Consensus Definition:\n\nEthical AI refers to the design, development, and deployment of artificial intelligence systems in alignment with established moral principles and societal values. These principles include fairness, accountability, transparency, privacy, safety, human-centricity, and the prevention of harm. Ethical AI ensures that AI technologies operate in a manner that is beneficial to society, respects human rights, mitigates biases, and maintains public trust through responsible practices and open reporting.\n\nKey Similarities:\n\nSimilarity 1: Fairness and Non-Discrimination\n- Multiple definitions emphasize the importance of ensuring that AI does not discriminate and treats all individuals and groups equitably.\n\nSimilarity 2: Transparency and Explainability\n- Many definitions highlight the need for AI systems to be transparent in their operations and decisions, allowing stakeholders to understand and scrutinize the processes.\n\nSimilarity 3: Accountability and Responsibility\n- Ensuring that those who develop and deploy AI systems can be held accountable for their actions and decisions is a common theme.\n\nSimilarity 4: Privacy and Security\n- Protecting individual privacy and ensuring data security is consistently mentioned as a crucial aspect of ethical AI.\n\nSimilarity 5: Human-Centric Values\n- The emphasis on aligning AI with human values and ensuring human control over AI systems is a recurring theme.\n\nSimilarity 6: Mitigation of Harm and Safety\n- Preventing harm, ensuring safety, and conducting responsible oversight of AI systems are frequently highlighted.\n\nKey Disagreements/Variations:\n\nVariation 1: Scope of Societal and Environmental Well-being\n- While some definitions include broader societal and environmental considerations, others focus primarily on immediate human impacts.\n\nVariation 2: Level of Regulatory Compliance\n- Some descriptions emphasize adherence to existing laws and regulations, whereas others go beyond legal compliance to consider broader ethical obligations.\n\nVariation 3: Specific Ethical Principles Highlighted\n- There is variation in the specific ethical principles emphasized, such as explainability, inclusiveness, contestability, or robustness, which are mentioned more prominently in some definitions than others.\n\nVariation 4: Operationalization and Context of Ethics\n- The context and level at which ethical considerations are operationalized, including industry-specific guidelines versus universally applicable principles, differ among the definitions.\n\nVariation 5: Inclusion of Governance and Oversight Mechanisms\n- Some definitions stress the importance of governance, oversight, and systematic methods for ensuring ethical AI, while others focus more on the principles themselves."
