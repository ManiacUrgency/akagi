    "keyword": " explainability",
    "definition": "Consensus Definition:\n\nExplainability refers to the ability of AI systems to make their decision-making processes transparent and understandable to humans. This involves providing clear, traceable, and interpretable explanations for how AI models generate outcomes, ensuring stakeholders can comprehend and scrutinize the rationale behind decisions. This practice is essential for building trust, ensuring accountability, and enabling effective oversight.\n\n### Key Similarities:\n\nSimilarity 1: Transparency  \nNearly all definitions emphasize the importance of transparency, indicating that AI systems must make their internal decision-making processes clear to users.\n\nSimilarity 2: Understandability  \nThe concept of making AI processes understandable to non-experts and stakeholders is a recurring theme, underscoring the need for explanations that are accessible and easy to grasp.\n\nSimilarity 3: Traceability  \nSeveral definitions mention the ability to trace decisions back to their underlying data and algorithms, ensuring a clear line of reasoning that stakeholders can follow.\n\nSimilarity 4: Building Trust    \nThe importance of explainability in building trust in AI systems is highlighted in multiple definitions, emphasizing its role in fostering user confidence.\n\nSimilarity 5: Accountability  \nEnsuring that AI systems operate in an accountable manner is a shared theme, pointing towards the need for explainability to facilitate governance and oversight.\n\n### Key Disagreements/Variations:\n\nVariation 1: Adaptation to User Requirements  \nSome definitions highlight that explanations should be tailored to the user's needs (e.g., non-experts vs. experts), while others do not address this aspect.\n\nVariation 2: Technical Techniques for Explainability  \nCertain passages mention specific techniques like Shapley values and Counterfactual Explanations for achieving explainability, whereas others focus more on the conceptual level.\n\nVariation 3: Degree of Detail  \nSome definitions suggest providing very detailed, symbolic explanations of AI behavior, while others focus on more high-level, general comprehensibility.\n\nVariation 4: Focus Areas (Ethics vs. Practical Use)  \nThere's a variance in focusing on ethical dimensions (e.g., compliance with societal norms) versus practical, everyday understandability for users and stakeholders.\n\nVariation 5: Type of AI Models  \nSome texts make distinctions between different types of AI models (e.g., machine learning models, neural networks) and their specific challenges in explainability, while others treat AI systems more homogeneously.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- The consensus definition incorporates the most emphasized points across the various definitions while also considering some unique insights to add depth.\n- Where definitions diverge, the synthesized version aims to bridge these gaps without overly complicating the language, ensuring clarity and conciseness."
