    "definition": "### Consensus Definition:\n\nRobustness in AI refers to the ability of an AI system to maintain its performance, reliability, and functionality across a wide variety of conditions, including adversarial contexts, distributional shifts, and noisy or corrupted data. This involves ensuring that the system can withstand attempts to deceive or disrupt its operations and continue to produce accurate, reliable outcomes.\n\n### Key Similarities:\n\n1. Performance Maintenance:\n   - Most definitions emphasize the AI system's ability to maintain its performance or functionality across different conditions or scenarios.\n   \n2. Handling Adversarial Conditions:\n   - Several definitions highlight the importance of an AI system's ability to resist adversarial attacks or perturbations.\n\n3. Reliability and Resilience:\n   - The repeated concepts of reliability and resilience underscore the system's ability to function well even when faced with challenges or disruptions.\n\n4. Functionality Across Conditions:\n   - Many definitions point to the AI system\u2019s capability to operate effectively across varied environments or datasets.\n\n### Key Disagreements/Variations:\n\n1. Scope of Robustness:\n   - Some definitions focus on robustness specifically in the context of adversarial attacks, while others take a broader view that includes general reliability and functionality under various conditions.\n\n2. Technical vs. Social Perspectives:\n   - Definitions like the one from \"The use of responsible artificial intelligence techniques in the context of loan approval processes\" consider robustness from both technical and social perspectives, making it more comprehensive.\n\n3. Inclusion of Learning Invariance:\n   - The definition from \"Causal learning for socially responsible AI\" introduces the concept of learning invariant causal relations to avoid overfitting, which is less commonly mentioned in other definitions.\n\n4. Focus on Interpretation and Explanation Methods:\n   - The definition from \"Towards a responsible AI development lifecycle: Lessons from information security\" uniquely emphasizes robustness in model interpretation and explanation methods, which is distinct from the more general focus in other definitions.\n\nBy synthesizing these points, we can balance the commonalities while acknowledging the unique contributions to formulate a comprehensive definition."
