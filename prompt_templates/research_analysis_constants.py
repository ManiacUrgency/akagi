THEMATIC_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """
Conduct a thematic analysis on the definitions of Responsible AI provided from the literature sources. The aim is to identify common themes, patterns, and prevalent concepts in these definitions.

Identify the initial codes, group similar codes together to create broader themes that capture the main ideas or concepts recurring across multiple definitions. Review these themes to ensure they accurately represent the data. Merge similar themes, split complex themes, and discard irrelevant ones as needed. Clearly define what each theme represents and assign a concise name to each theme.

In your analysis, identify and describe the common themes that appear frequently across the definitions. Highlight patterns in how different sources define Responsible AI. Are there recurring elements or concepts? Note any significant differences or unique approaches in the definitions. Additionally, identify any aspects of Responsible AI that are rarely mentioned or overlooked in the definitions.

Provide a summary report detailing the themes, patterns, and divergences identified in the analysis. For each theme, include a description, examples from the definitions, and any relevant observations.

For example, consider the definietion, "Responsible AI rfers to AI systems that are designed and deployed with consideration of ethical principles, transparency, and accountability." From this, you might identify initial codes such as ethical principles, transparency, and accountability, leading to a potential theme of Ethical Considerations. Similarly, for the definition, "Responsible AI ensures that AI technologies are fair, non-discriminatory, and respect user privacy," the initial codes might be fairness, non-discriminatory, and privacy, leading to a potential theme of Fairness and Privacy.

Ensure that your analysis is thorough and unbiased, providing clear explanations for how themes were derived from the initial codes. Consider the context provided by each source when analyzing the definitions. Use this structured approach to guide the thematic analysis, synthesizing the definitions into coherent themes that highlight commonalities and differences, providing a deeper understanding of how Responsible AI is conceptualized in the literature.
"""

COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """
Conduct a comparative analysis of definitions and frameworks of Responsible AI from the literature sources to highlight differences and similarities in approaches.

Identify key elements, concepts, or components in each definition. What are the main aspects emphasized in each definition or framework?

Compare and contrast these definitions and frameworks. What similarities can you identify between different definitions? Are there recurring elements or concepts that multiple sources agree upon? Highlight these commonalities to show areas of consensus.

Next, identify the differences between the definitions and frameworks. How do certain definitions or frameworks stand out? What unique approaches or components are present in some but absent in others? Note any significant variations in the interpretation or application of Responsible AI.

Consider the context provided by each source. How does the context influence the definition or framework proposed? Are there specific factors or perspectives that lead to variations in definitions?

Provide a summary report detailing the similarities and differences identified in the analysis. For each comparison, include a description, examples from the definitions and frameworks, and relevant observations. Can you provide specific examples that illustrate the similarities and differences?

For example, consider the definition, "Responsible AI refers to AI systems designed with ethical principles, transparency, and accountability." Compare this with another definition, "Responsible AI ensures AI technologies are fair, non-discriminatory, and respect privacy." What elements do these definitions share? How do they differ in their focus or approach?

Ensure your analysis is thorough and unbiased. Provide clear explanations for how similarities and differences were identified. What steps ensure objectivity in your analysis? Use this structured approach to guide the comparative analysis, sntheysizing the definitions and frameworks into a coherent understanding of how Responsible AI is conceptualized across different sources. What insights can you draw about the current state of Responsible AI from these comparisons?

""" 

OPPORTUNITY_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """
Identify significant gaps and discrepancies in definitions and frameworks of Responsible AI from the literature sources, highlighting areas needing further research.

Note areas where definitions or frameworks diverge significantly. What are the key differences or contradictions between definitions?

Identify gaps in the literature. What important aspects of Responsible AI are rarely mentioned or completely overlooked? Are there components or perspectives that are consistently missing across the definitions?

Compare the identified definitions and frameworks. How do certain definitions or frameworks stand out or contradict each other? What unique approaches or components are present in some definitions but absent in others?

Consider the context provided by each source. How does the context influence the definitions or frameworks proposed? Are there specific factors or perspectives that lead to variations in definitions? Are there areas where the existing definitions fail to address key issues in Responsible AI?

Provide a summary report detailing the gaps and discrepancies identified. For each gap or discrepancy, include a description, examples from the definitions and frameworks, and relevant observations. Can you provide specific examples that illustrate these gaps and discrepancies? If possible, create a visual representation, like a gap analysis chart, to clearly show these relationships.

For example, consider the definition, "Responsible AI refers to AI systems designed with ethical principles, transparency, and accountability." Compare this with another definition, "Responsible AI ensures AI technologies are fair, non-discriminatory, and respect privacy." What elements do these definitions share, and where do they diverge? How do they differ in their focus or approach? Are there significant aspects of Responsible AI not addressed by either definition?

Ensure your analysis is thorough and unbiased. Provide clear explanations for how gaps and discrepancies were identified. What steps ensure objectivity in your analysis? Use this structured approach to guide the identification of gaps and discrepancies, synthesizing the definitions and frameworks into a coherent understanding of where further research is needed in Responsible AI. What insights can you draw about the current state of Responsible AI and areas that require more attention?
