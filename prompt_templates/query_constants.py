Why is there an increasing demand for transparency in the use of black-box Machine Learning models, especially in critical contexts such as precision medicine, autonomous vehicles, security, and finance?

Document 1:
As black-box Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly being employed to make important predictions in critical contexts, the demand for transparency is increasing from various stakeholders in AI. The danger lies in creating and using decisions that are not justifiable, legitimate, or that simply do not allow for obtaining detailed explanations of their behavior. Explanations supporting the output of a model are crucial, e.g., in precision medicine, where experts require far more information from the model than a simple binary prediction for supporting their diagnosis. Other examples include autonomous vehicles in transportation, security, and finance, among others.

Responsible AI refers to the implementation and use of AI models in a manner that adheres to a set of principles designed to mitigate potential threats to individuals and society. These principles include fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability, among others. The concept emphasizes that while Explainable AI (XAI) is crucial, it is not sufficient on its own to ensure responsible AI practices. Other principles such as privacy and fairness must also be carefully addressed in practice [1].

eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) refers to a field within AI that focuses on making the decision-making processes of AI models transparent and understandable to humans. This is particularly important for the practical deployment of AI models, as it addresses the inherent problem of explainability in modern techniques such as ensembles and Deep Neural Networks, which were not present in earlier AI systems like expert systems and rule-based models [1].
