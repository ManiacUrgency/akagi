Although AI has signiﬁcant potential to transform society, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions responsibly. Many ethical regulations, principles, and guidelines for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, these principles are high-level and difﬁcult to put into practice. In the meantime much effort has been put into responsible AI from the algorithm perspective, but they are limited to a small subset of ethical principles amenable to mathematical analysis. Responsible AI issues go beyond data and algorithms and are often at the system-level crosscutting many system components and the entire software engineering lifecycle.

Although AI has signiﬁcant potential and capacity to stimulate economic growth and improve productivity across agrowing range of domains, there are serious concerns about the AI systems’ ability to behave and make decisions in aresponsible manner. According Gartner’s recent report, 21% of organizations have already deployed or plan to deployresponsible AI technologies within the next 12 months .Many ethical principles, and guidelines have been recently issued by governments, research institutions, and compa-nies . However, these principles are high-level and can hardly be used in practice by developers. Responsible AIresearch has been focusing on algorithm solutions limited to a subset of issues such as fairness. Ethical issues canenter at any point of the software engineering lifecycle and are often at the system-level crosscutting many componentsof AI systems.

The research question is: ”What solutions forresponsible AI can be identiﬁed?” The research question focuses on identifying the reusable patterns for responsible AI.We used ”AI”, ”Responsible”, ”Solution” as the key terms and included synonyms and abbreviations as supplementaryterms to increase the search results. The main data sources are ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct,Springer Link, and Google Scholar. The study only includes the papers that present concrete design or process solutionsfor responsible AI, and excludes the papers that only discuss high-level frameworks.

From the causal perspective, fairness can be formulated asestimating causal effects of sensitive attributes such as gen-der on the outcome of an AI system. Such causal effectsare evaluated using counterfactual interventions over a causalgraph with features, sensitive attributes, and other variables.Underpinning this approach is the concept of counterfactualfairness (CF) [Kusner et al., 2017]. CF implies that a de-cision is considered fair if it is the same in both “the actualworld” and “a counterfactual world” where, e.g., for an indi-vidual belongs to a different demographic group.

EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) refers to a field within AI that focuses on making the decision-making processes of AI models transparent and understandable to humans. This is particularly important for the practical deployment of AI models, as it addresses the inherent problem of explainability in modern techniques such as ensembles and Deep Neural Networks, which were not present in earlier AI systems like expert systems and rule-based models.

Some argue these valuesshould be naturally embedded in an organization\u2019s culture. Several organizations have also published guidelinesdescribing what values they believe AI systems should embody. Jobin et al.  found these guidelines to convergearound central values, but differ in how they construe these values and concepts. Critics note that reliable methodsto translate values into practice are often missing. Some also argue that statements of high-level values andprinciples are too ambiguous and may gain consensus simply by masking the complexity and contending interpretationsof ethical concepts.

As black-box Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly being employed to make important predictions in critical contexts, the demand for transparency is increasing from various stakeholders in AI [1]. The danger lies in creating and using decisions that are not justifiable, legitimate, or that simply do not allow for obtaining detailed explanations of their behavior [2]. Explanations supporting the output of a model are crucial, e.g., in precision medicine, where experts require far more information from the model than a simple binary prediction for supporting their diagnosis [3]. Other examples include autonomous vehicles in transportation, security, and finance, among others [4].
