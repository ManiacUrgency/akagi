It encompasses the challenge of developing and applying fairness metrics in AI systems, acknowledging trade-offs between different metrics, and addressing broader societal issues of discrimination and inequality that arise within the usage and deployment of AI. This approach demands a multi-disciplinary perspective that integrates technical, social, and ethical considerations to adequately address the principles of fairness in AI."
