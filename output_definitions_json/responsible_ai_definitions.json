Accountability requires AI systems to explain and justify their decisions, linking these to underlying algorithms and moral values. Responsibility involves both the societal and individual obligation to ensure AI systems' actions are fair, and that errors or unexpected outcomes are identified and addressed. Transparency means AI systems must be able to describe, inspect, and reproduce their decision-making processes and the governance of the data they use. Additionally, the responsible design of AI must embed ethical principles and human values explicitly throughout their development. Finally, to achieve Responsible AI, the participation and education of all societal stakeholders are essential, ensuring a well-rounded understanding and governance of AI technologies."

They critique current efforts for focusing on low-order interventions like algorithmic tweaks and recommend examining and addressing the underlying structural causes and purposes of AI systems. Responsible AI, according to the authors, requires interventions at multiple levels\u2014Parameters (tangible technical fixes), Processes (social and technical interactions), Pathways (information flow and governance), and Purpose (norms, values, and paradigms). They argue for a methodological shift from symptomatic fixes to transformational changes to address the root causes of AI issues. This multi-domain approach aims for a comprehensive transformation in the design, development, and deployment of AI systems, encouraging a broader, transdisciplinary perspective."
