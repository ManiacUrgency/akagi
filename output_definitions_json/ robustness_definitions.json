It involves developing techniques that ensure the resilience of the model against adversarial attacks, such as data poisoning, which can degrade performance by introducing erroneous or intentionally corrupted data into the training process. Robustness can be achieved through methods like data sanitization before model training or adapting the training process itself to withstand the presence of poisoned data."
