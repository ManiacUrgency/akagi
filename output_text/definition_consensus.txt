### Abstract

In an era marked by rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the imperative for Responsible AI (RAI) becomes increasingly significant. Despite extensive discussions, a consensus on the definitions of RAI and its defining sub-pillars—privacy, accountability, ethics, robustness, and explainability—remains elusive. Addressing this gap, our study aims to establish clear and comprehensive definitions for each of these sub-pillars and synthesize these into a cohesive understanding of Responsible AI. Utilizing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, we analyzed definitions from 61 academic papers retrieved via Google Scholar, extracting key similarities and variations.

Our findings reveal significant commonalities across definitions, such as the emphasis on safeguarding user privacy, ensuring AI transparency and accountability, adhering to ethical principles, maintaining robustness across varied conditions, and providing clear explainability of AI systems. However, our analysis also unearths notable variations, including contextual adaptations and depth of focus on specific responsible practices. The consensus definitions developed highlight the multifaceted nature of Responsible AI, ensuring alignment with ethical and legal standards, and prioritizing human-centric values and societal benefit.

The implications of our research are profound, suggesting a structured approach for the AI community to operationalize these principles effectively. This work contributes towards bridging the existing definitional gaps, fostering greater coherence and consistency in the discourse of Responsible AI. Furthermore, it lays a foundational framework for future research and practical implementations aimed at ensuring AI systems' development and deployment are aligned with broader societal values and ethical standards.

In conclusion, our comprehensive definitions of Responsible AI and its sub-pillars offer a robust framework that can be universally applied, fostering trust, accountability, and ethical integrity in AI systems. Future research should explore the operationalization of these definitions in various industry-specific contexts to ensure practical and actionable adherence to these principles.
